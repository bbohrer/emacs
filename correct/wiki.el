Dewi Claire Schreefel (born 12 November 1985) is a Dutch female
professional golfer currently playing on the LPGA Tour and formerly on
the Futures Tour.  Schreefel was born in Alkmaar, Netherlands on 12
November 1985. She resides in the village of Diepenveen located within
the municipality of Deventer. Her father is Indonesian and her mother
is Dutch.

Amateur and college career[edit] As a junior player, Schreefel won the
Dutch Stroke-Play Championship five times, in 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003
and 2004. She also won the 2004 Italian Women's Amateur Championship
and the Dutch Match-Play Championship. She attended the University of
Southern California where she was a member of the 2008 NCAA National
Championship team, was the 2006 NCAA Individual champion, a three-time
All-American and finished in the top-10 14 times. She had three wins
during her college career.[1] She graduated with a bachelors degree in
sociology.[citation needed]

Professional career[edit] Schreefel turned professional in 2008, and
joined the Futures Tour on 27 January 2009. She had one win on the
Futures Tour in her rookie season and finished tenth on the
season-ending money list to earn LPGA Tour status for 2010, although
she was unable to gain entry into any LPGA events in 2010 because of
her low status on the LPGA priority list and she played a second full
season on the Futures Tour that year. She finished tied for fourth
place in the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament on 12 December 2010 to
earn full playing status on the LPGA for 2011.[2]

The Israeli Beach Soccer League (Hebrew: הליגה הישראלית בכדורגל
חופים‎), currently known as Ligat Bank Yahav (Hebrew: ליגת בנק יהב‎) for
sponsorship reasons, is the top division in the Israeli Beach Soccer
league. In July 2007 the league was inaugurated under the supervision
of the Israel Football Association. To celebrate the launch of the
league, a friendly game between national teams of England and Israel
was played, with the Israelis winning 6–5.

Background[edit] The league first edition took place every Friday at
Netanya Poleg beach on newly built beach sports stadium. The players
participating in ligat San-Miguel were active and retired football
players, Futsal players and some talents who was found by the league
scouts. At the end of the season, Netanya's diamonds won the
championship, after beating MZ Rosh HaAyin 5–2 in the final.[1] An
average of 9.23 goals per match was scored during the season, higher
average than the average in most of the beach soccer World Cups.

The second season of the Israeli Beach Soccer League featured ten
teams divided to two groups of five. Each team played one game against
the teams in its group. The top four teams in each group qualified to
the quarter finals, which was played on July 18 and 25, 2008.  The
final-four matches and the relegation playoff were played on August
1. 90FM Hadera's Princes won the championship in its first season in
the league, after a 7–6 win against Shav'e Shav'e Jerusalem.  The
average number of goals dropped drastically in comparison with the
first season, with 261 goals in 33 games, an average of 7.9 goals in a
match.

The third season of the Israeli Beach Soccer won by Ironi Misadot
Achla Petah Tikva after a 2–0 win against Netanya's Diamonds in the
final on August 14, 2009.

The fourth season of the Israeli Beach Soccer won by Kidmat Eden
Kfar Saba after a 5–3 win against Netanya's Diamonds in the final on
August 20, 2010.

The fifth season of the Israeli Beach Soccer won by Ironi Electis
Rosh HaAyin after a 8-5 win against Netanya's Diamonds in the final on
July 29, 2011.

The sixth season of the Israeli Beach Soccer won by Bnei Kafr Qasim
after a 2-1 penalty shoot out (the game ended at a 4-4 draw, after
Rosh Ha'Ayin lead 4-0) against Ironi Rosh Ha'Ayin in the final on 20
July 2012.

The seventh season of the Israeli Beach Soccer won by Bnei Kafr Qasim
after a 5-3 win against Maccabi Doron Motors Netanya in the final on
26 July 2013.

After the first season of the league, the champion, Netanya's
Diamonds, was invited to participate in the European Beach Soccer
champions league. Netanya finished fourth, after defeating the
Estonian champions 10–4 in the quarterfinals, losing to the Czech
champions 7–8 after extra time in the semifinals, and losing to the
Spanish champions 6–8 in the match for third place.[2][3][4][5] The
runner-up, MZ Rosh HaAyin, was invited to the Capital Cup, the
equivalent of association football's UEFA Cup. Rosh HaAyin won the
tournament, after defeating AEK Limasol 3–1, Apoel Nicosia 5–2, AEK
Thessaloniki 3–2 and Boca Juniors 6–3 in the final.[6]

National team[edit] Main article: Israel national beach soccer team In
June 2007 newborn Israeli national team first participated in Group B
qualifying games of Euro Beach Soccer League in Athens. After 6–6 draw
they lose by penalty kicks to Russia, and celebrated first ever
victory on Greece 2–1.

Diamonds Tournament[edit] In August 2007 first ever Pro Beach Soccer
Tour Diamonds Tournament[7] was held in Israel. Four teams: Germany,
Turkey, Israel and France led by Eric Cantona,[8][9] took part. In the
final Israel won Germany 4–3.[10]

2008 Challenge Cup[edit] In June 2008 the FIFA Beach Soccer Challenge
Cup was held in Israel. The six national teams competed to achieve
single ticket to Group A of Euro Beach Soccer League. Czech Republic,
Germany, Hungary, Israel, Norway & Turkey took part. Israeli national
team won the tournament[11] beating in final Germany 4–3.

Maslama al-Majriti or Abu al-Qasim al-Qurtubi al-Majriti (Arabic: أبو
القاسم مسلمة بن أحمد المجريطي‎, Latin: Methilem; d. 1008 or 1007 CE)
was a Muslim astronomer, chemist, mathematician, economist and Scholar
in Islamic Spain. He took part in the translation of Ptolemy's
Planispherium, improved existing translations of the Almagest,
introduced and improved the astronomical tables of al-Khwarizmi, aided
historians by working out tables to convert Persian dates to Hijri
years, and introduced the techniques of surveying and
triangulation.[1]



Al-Majriti was one of the earliest Alchemists to record the usage and
experimentation of mercuric oxide.  He was among the most brilliant of
Spanish Muslims during the reign of Al-Hakam II. According to Şā'id
ibn Ahmad Andalusī he was the best mathematician and astronomer of his
time (in Al-Andalus).[2]:64 He also introduced new surveying methods
by working closely with his colleague Ibn al-Saffar. He also wrote a
book on taxation and the economy of Al-Andalus.[1]

He edited and made changes to the parts of the Encyclopedia of the
Brethren of Sincerity when the encyclopaedia arrived in
Al-Andalus[3][4]

Al-Majriti also predicted a futuristic process of scientific
interchange and the advent of networks for scientific
communication. He built a school of Astronomy and Mathematics and
marked the beginning of organized scientific research in
Al-Andalus. Among his students were Ibn al-Saffar, Abu al-Salt and
Al-Tartushi.[2]:64

Pseudo alMajriti[edit] From his date of death, inconsistencies result
in the dating of two influential works in early chemistry attributed
to him,[1] as either they were published long after his death, or they
were the work of someone else claiming some of his glory: the latter
is the current general belief.[2]

The two works are the Sage's Step/The Rank of the Wise (Rutbat
al-hakim, ?1009) and the Aim of the Wise (Ghayat al-hakim). Both
were translated into Latin, in a version somewhat bowdlerised by
Christian dogma, in 1252 on the orders of King Alfonso X of Castile;
the original Arabic text dates probably from the middle of the
eleventh century.

The Rutbat includes alchemical formulae and instructions for
purification of precious metals, and was also the first to note the
principle of conservation of mass, which he did in the course of his
pathbreaking experiment on mercuric oxide:

I took natural quivering mercury, free from impurity, and placed it in
a glass vessel shaped like an egg. This I put inside another vessel
like a cooking pot, and set the whole apparatus over an extremely
gentle fire. The outer pot was then in such a degree of heat that I
could bear my hand upon it. I heated the apparatus day and night for
forty day, after which I opened it. I found that the mercury (the
original weight of which was a quarter of a pound) had been completely
converted into red powder, soft to touch, the weight remaining as it
was originally.

The Ghayat is more concerned with advanced esotericism, principally
astrology and talismanic magic, although he also goes into
prophecy. The author considers this the advanced level of work,
occasionally referring to the Rutbat as the foundation text.

Information and Communication Technologies for Environmental
Sustainability (ICT Ensure) is a general term referring to the
application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
within the field of environmental sustainability. Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) are acting as integrating and
enabling technologies for the economy and they have a profound impact
on our society. Recent changes in ICT use globally have impacted the
environment negatively (in terms of waste and energy consumption etc)
but also have the potential to support environmental sustainability
activities[1] , such as the targets set within the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) number 7 (MDG7) to “ensure environmental
sustainability”.[2]

New technologies provide utilities for knowledge acquisition and
awareness, early evaluation of new knowledge, reaching agreements and
communication of progress in the interest of the human welfare. This
includes ethical aspects of protecting human life as well as aspects
of consumer safety and the preservation of our natural environment.  A
viral quasispecies is a group of viruses related by a similar mutation
or mutations, competing within a highly mutagenic environment. The
theory predicts that a viral quasispecies at a low but evolutionarily
neutral and highly connected (that is, flat) region in the fitness
landscape will outcompete a quasispecies located at a higher but
narrower fitness peak in which the surrounding mutants are
unfit.[1][2] This phenomenon has been called 'the quasispecies effect'
or, more recently, the 'survival of the flattest'.[3]

Originally used by Manfred Eigen to model the evolution of the first
macromolecules on earth, the quasispecies concept has been applied to
populations of a virus within its host.[4] The quasispecies model is
deemed to be relevant to RNA viruses because they have high mutation
rates in the order of one per round of replication,[5] and viral
populations, while not infinite, are extremely large. Thus the
practical conditions for quasispecies formation are thought to exist.

The significance of the quasispecies model for virology is that, if
the mutation rate is sufficiently high, selection acts on clouds of
mutants rather than individual sequences.[6] Therefore, the
evolutionary trajectory of the viral infection cannot be predicted
solely from the characteristics of the fittest sequence.[7]

The importance of quasispecies concepts in virology has been the
subject of some discussion.[8][9][10] Significantly, it has been shown
that there is no necessary conflict between a quasispecies model of
intra-host evolution and traditional population genetics.[6] Instead,
viral quasispecies can be considered as cases of coupled
mutation-selection balance models for haploid organisms.

It may be useful to understand the etymology of the term. Quasispecies
are clouds of related elements that behave almost (quasi) like a
single type of molecule (species). There is no suggestion that a viral
quasispecies resembles a traditional biological species.



Possible consequences for viral evolution[edit]


fig. 1: A sharp selection profile.


fig. 2: A broader, more realistic selection profile.  Error
threshold[edit] This may be defined as “The inability of a genetic
element to be maintained in a population as the fidelity of its
replication machinery decreases beyond a certain threshold value”.[11]

In theory, if the mutation rate was sufficiently high, the viral
population would not be able to maintain the genotype with the highest
fitness, and therefore the ability of the population to adapt to its
environment would be compromised. A practical application of this
dynamic is in antiviral drugs employing lethal mutagenesis. For
example, increased doses of the mutagen Ribavirin reduces the
infectivity of Poliovirus.[12]

However, these models assume that only the mutations that occur in the
fittest sequence are deleterious, and furthermore that they are
non-lethal (fig. 1). It has been argued that, if we take into account
the deleterious effect of mutations on the population of variants and
the fact that that many mutations are lethal (fig. 2), then the Error
Threshold disappears, i.e. the fittest sequence always maintains
itself.[6][11][13] Empirical data on the effect of mutations in
viruses is rare, but appears to correspond more closely to fig. 2.[14]

Mutational robustness[edit] The long-term evolution of the virus may
be influenced in that it may be a better evolutionarily stable
strategy to generate a broad quasispecies with members of
approximately equal fitness than to have a sharply defined 'most fit'
single genotype (with mutational neighbours substantially less
fit). This has been called 'survival of the flattest' - referring to
the fitness profiles of the two strategies respectively.[2]

Over the long-term, a flatter fitness profile might better allow a
quasispecies to exploit changes in selection pressure, analogous to
the way sexual organisms use recombination to preserve diversity in a
population. At least in simulations, a slower replicator can be shown
to be able to outcompete a faster one in cases where it is more robust
and the mutation rate is high.[1]

However, whether mutational robustness evolved or is intrinsic to
genetic systems is unconfirmed, because the basic mechanism behind
robustness would depend upon the peculiarities of each system.[3]

Cooperation[edit] Experimental manipulation of poliovirus to give them
a higher-fidelity polymerase – and hence reduce their mutation rate –
showed these variants to have lower pathogenicity than wild-type
sequences.[15] Pathogenicity could then be restored by mutagen
application. This was interpreted to mean lower mutation rates had
reduced the adaptability (or breadth) of the quasispecies. The mutant
viruses extracted from brain tissue were not themselves pathogenic,
and the authors speculate that there may be complementation between
variant members of the quasispecies that could enable viruses to
colonize different host tissues and systems.


Jasper Yeuell (23 March 1925 – 2003) was an English professional
footballer.

After emerging fom the junior ranks of West Bromwich Albion, Yeuell
signed professional forms with Portsmouth in 1946. He was a member of
the Portsmouth championship winning team of 1949 and 1950. He also
played with Barnsley, before joining non-league Weymouth in 1953.

Brian John McKechnie (born 6 November 1953 in Gore, Southland, New
Zealand) was a double All Black, that is, he represented New Zealand
in both rugby union and cricket.

He played 26 matches for the All Blacks as a first five-eighth and
fullback, most memorably being the player to kick the winning penalty
goal against Wales in 1978 when Andy Haden dived out off a lineout
near full-time and was apparently awarded a penalty (the referee later
said the penalty was for a completely separate incident and was
clearly visible in video footage) which would secure the Grand Slam
for the All Blacks against the home country unions.

As a cricketer, McKechnie was an economical right-arm pace bowler and
useful lower-order batsman who played 14 one day games for the Black
Caps, including the 1975 and 1979 World Cup tournaments in
England. His last match for New Zealand was the infamous underarm
match against Australia in 1981, when McKechnie was the batsman who
faced Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery in the final ball of the
match. McKechnie represented Otago in domestic competitions from
1971-72 to 1985-86. He later served on the national selection panel.

With Lynn McConnell, he wrote McKechnie: Double All Black: An
Autobiography (Craigs, Invercargill) in 1983.[1]

Patiala Airport (Patiala Aviation Complex) is a civil aerodrome
serving Patiala, Punjab in India. It was built by Maharajadhiraj
Bhupinder Singh of Patiala in the first decade of the twentieth
century[citation needed] as a place to operate his aircraft. After
Independence it was taken over by the Government of India and turned
into a civil aerodrome.

There are in total five hangars in Patiala Aviation Complex. The First
Hangar is used by Patiala Aviation Club (P.A.C.), which is flying
training Institute approved by Directorate General of Civil Aviation
(D.G.C.A.), India. Raja Kamendra Singh (Prince Ralph) son of Maharaja
Bhupinder Singh was Chief Flight Instructor of P.A.C. until his death
in an aircraft crash in 1995. Presently Capt. Malkeat Singh is the
Chief Flight Instructor of P.A.C.

The Second Hangar which was initially the Government owned Engine and
instrument overhauling workshop, then for some period was used by
Northern India Flying Club (N.I.F.C). These days is being used by
Birmi Flying Academy (B.F.A.) as flying training institute approved by
D.G.C.A.The Chief Flight Instructor of B.F.A. is
Capt. K.T. Rajendran.[1]

The Third Hangar is the workshop of the Punjab Aircraft Maintenance
Engineering College (P.A.M.E.C.)in which students are being trained to
become future engineers.

The Fourth Hangar is alloted to the National Cadet Corps. (N.C.C.)Air
Wing. Here the cadets along with their routine exercises enjoy the
flying in Microlight Aircraft provided by Indian Air Force for the
purpose.

The Fifth Hangar is known as the student Hanger, as and maintenance of
the VIP aircraft owned by Govt. of Punjab.

Patiala Airport is sometimes used by Captain Amarinder Singh the
current Maharaja of Patiala and by the state government to operate its
fleet of aircraft.[citation needed] The A.T.C. at Patiala Airport is
Maintained By Air Ops (Army Aviation) a unit of Indian Army.

Dr. Lakshminarayana Subramaniam (born 23 July 1947) is an acclaimed
Indian violinist, composer and conductor, trained in the classical
Carnatic music tradition and Western classical music, and renowned for
his virtuoso playing techniques and compositions in orchestral fusion.

Early years[edit] Subramaniam was born in a Hindu Tamil Brahmin family
to V. Lakshminarayana, and Seethalakshmi, both accomplished musicians.

He lived in Jaffna during his younger years, taking up music studies
before the age of five.[1] He began training in violin under the
tutelage of his father, Professor V. Lakshminarayana. “Mani”, as he is
fondly known by fellow musicians and his family, gave his first public
performance at the age of six.

His brothers are also acclaimed musicians, and include the well-known
violinist-composers L. Shankar (alias. Shenkar), and the late
L. Vaidyanathan.[2] He has released recordings with both.

Subramaniam developed a passion for music as well as science from a
young age, studying Medicine and acquiring his M.B.B.S. at Madras
Medical College. He registered as a General Practitioner, before
deciding to pursue music full-time.[1] He has a Master’s degree in
Western classical music, which he acquired at the California Institute
of the Arts.[1]

Performing career[edit]


Yehudi Menuhin, Stephane Grappelli and L. Subramaniam Since 1973,
Subramaniam has amassed over 200 recordings to his credit, releasing
several historic solo albums, recording collaborations with musicians
Yehudi Menuhin, Stéphane Grappelli, Ruggiero Ricci and Jean-Pierre
Rampal, further to making albums and performing with Ruggiero Ricci,
Herbie Hancock, Joe Sample, Jean-Luc Ponty, Stanley Clarke John Handy,
George Harrison [3] and several others.[4]

He has accompanied highly regarded vocalists in Carnatic music on
stage including Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, K. V. Narayaswamy,
Dr. Sripada Pinakapani, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer,
M. Balamuralikrishna and M. D. Ramanathan. He has also performed many
concerts with the venerable Palghat Mani Iyer on the Mridangam, in
addition to collaborating with musicians of North Indian Hindustani
music and artists of other music systems.[4]

Subramaniam has written works for orchestras, ballets and Hollywood
film scores, and written books on music - such as Euphony - in
addition to composing symphonies and Carnatic pieces.[4][5]

In 1983, he composed a Double Concerto for violin and flute which
combined western scales with micro intervals. Another release, Spring
– Rhapsody, was a homage to Bach and Baroque music. Creations with
orchestras that have followed include Fantasy on Vedic Chants with the
New York Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta, Turbulence with The
Swiss Romande Orchestra, “The Concert of Two Violins” with the Oslo
Philharmonic, and Global Symphony with the Berlin State Opera
(broadcast live to 28 nations) among others.[5] He has also performed
a concert tour of China, with the Beijing Symphony Orchestra in
Beijing.

His compositions have been used in stage presentations of leading
dance companies such as the San Jose Ballet company and the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater. Subramaniam composed the piece “Shanti
Priya” for the Mariinsky Ballet.

The release of his albums, including Global Fusion in 1999 have
brought Subramaniam widespread critical acclaim, and popularity for
his advanced playing. He founded and directs the Lakshminarayana
Global Music Festival, a festival based in India. In 2004, he
completed a world tour with the festival, including concerts in the US
(Lincoln Center, New York), the Asian Pacific region including in
Perth, Australia, at the Esplanade, Singapore, the Sri Dewan Penang
Hall in Penang and the Putra World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia. Performing with Subramaniam at the festival in January 2005
were violin maestro Arve Tellefsen, the Oslo Camerata, jazz legends
Stanley Clarke, George Duke, Al Jarreau, Earl Klugh and Ravi Coltrane.

In September 2007, Subramaniam premiered and played “The Freedom
Symphony” with the Fairfax Symphony Orchestra, Warrenton Chorale and
Carnatic percussionists, which led to a strongly favourable ovation
and an encore piece “Flight of the Humble Bee”. Subramaniam is on the
advisory board of composer A. R. Rahman's KM Music Conservatory in
Kodambakkam, Chennai.

In 2011, he was invited to perform at the United Nations.[6]

On 24 October 2012, he performed as a Special Guest Artist with Stevie
Wonder at the latter's message of peace concert at the UN.[6]

The renowned violinist Yehudi Menuhin said of Subramaniam:

“ I find nothing more inspiring than the music making of my very great
colleague Subramaniam. Each time I listen to him, I am carried away in
wonderment.”[4] ” One of the most famous quote by Subramaniam goes by

“ Music is a vast ocean and no one can claim to know it all. The more
you know, the more you realise how little you know. It is an eternal
quest. ” Film career[edit] He composed the film scores for the films
Salaam Bombay (1988) and Mississippi Masala (1991) directed by Mira
Nair, in addition to being the featured violin soloist in Bernardo
Bertolucci's Little Buddha (1993) and Cotton Mary (1999) of
Merchant-Ivory productions.[4]

Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music)
and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). The 1945 work was adapted
from Ferenc Molnár's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting its Budapest
setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel
barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes
at the price of both their jobs. He attempts a robbery to provide for
Julie and their unborn child; after it goes wrong, he is given a
chance to make things right. A secondary plot line deals with
millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman
Enoch Snow. The show includes the well-known songs If I Loved You,
June Is Bustin' Out All Over and You'll Never Walk Alone. Richard
Rodgers later wrote that Carousel was his favorite of all his
musicals.

Following the spectacular success of the first Rodgers and Hammerstein
musical, Oklahoma! (1943), the pair sought to collaborate on another
piece, knowing that any resulting work would be compared with
Oklahoma!, most likely unfavorably. They were initially reluctant to
seek the rights to Liliom; Molnár had refused permission for the work
to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too
depressing for the musical theatre. After acquiring the rights, the
team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the
ending more hopeful.

The musical required considerable modification during out-of-town
tryouts, but once it opened on Broadway on April 19, 1945, it was an
immediate hit with both critics and audiences. Carousel initially ran
for 890 performances and duplicated its success in the West End in
1950. Though it has never achieved as much commercial success as
Oklahoma!, the piece has been repeatedly revived, and has been
recorded several times. A production by Nicholas Hytner enjoyed
success in 1992 in London, in 1994 in New York and on tour. In 1999,
Time magazine named Carousel the best musical of the 20th century.

Liliom[edit] Ferenc Molnár's Hungarian-language drama, Liliom,
premiered in Budapest in 1909. The audience was puzzled by the work,
and it lasted only thirty-odd performances before being withdrawn, the
first shadow on Molnár's successful career as a playwright. Liliom was
not presented again until after World War I. When it reappeared on the
Budapest stage, it was a tremendous hit.[1]



A star—please, my dear—I must do something good. Liliom (Joseph
Schildkraut) offers Louise (Evelyn Chard) the star he stole. 1921
Theatre Guild production.  Except for the ending, the plots of Liliom
and Carousel are very similar.[2] Andreas Zavocky (nicknamed Liliom,
the Hungarian word for lily, a slang term for tough guy),[3] a
carnival barker, falls in love with Julie Zeller, a servant girl, and
they begin living together. With both discharged from their jobs,
Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie, but decides not
to do so on learning that she is pregnant. A subplot involves Julie's
friend Marie, who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld, a hotel
porter—after the two marry, he becomes the owner of the
hotel. Desperate to make money so that he, Julie and their child can
escape to America and a better life, Liliom conspires with lowlife
Ficsur to commit a robbery, but it goes badly, and Liliom stabs
himself. He dies, and his spirit is taken to heaven's police court. As
Ficsur suggested while the two waited to commit the crime, would-be
robbers like them do not come before God Himself. Liliom is told by
the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to
redeem the wrongs he has done to his family, but must first spend
sixteen years in a fiery purgatory.[4]

On his return to Earth, Liliom encounters his daughter, Louise, who
like her mother is now a factory worker. Saying that he knew her
father, he tries to give her a star he stole from the heavens. When
Louise refuses to take it, he strikes her. Not realizing who he is,
Julie confronts him, but finds herself unable to be angry with
him. Liliom is ushered off to his fate, presumably Hell, and Louise
asks her mother if it is possible to feel a hard slap as if it was a
kiss. Julie reminiscently tells her daughter that it is very possible
for that to happen.[4]

An English translation of Liliom was credited to Benjamin Barney
Glazer, though there is a story that the actual translator,
uncredited, was Rodgers' first major partner Lorenz Hart.[5] The
Theatre Guild presented it in New York City in 1921, with Joseph
Schildkraut as Liliom,[5] and the play was a success, running 300
performances.[6] A 1940 revival, with Burgess Meredith and Ingrid
Bergman was seen by both Hammerstein and Rodgers.[5] Glazer, in
introducing the English translation of Liliom, wrote of the play's
appeal:

And where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be
matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she
had always been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant
carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves
gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf
posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands
looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her
ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom
lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the
star he has stolen for her in heaven. ... The temptation to count the
whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.[7]

Inception[edit] In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both
became well known for creating Broadway hits with other
partners. Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two
dozen musicals, including such popular successes as Babes in Arms
(1937), The Boys from Syracuse (1938) and Pal Joey (1940).[8] Some of
Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: On Your
Toes was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the
Slaughter on Tenth Avenue scene), while Pal Joey flouted Broadway
tradition by presenting a knave as its hero.[9] Hammerstein had
written or co-written the words for such hits as Rose-Marie (1924),
The Desert Song (1926), The New Moon (1927) and Show Boat
(1927). Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for
musicals and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome
Kern, The Last Time I Saw Paris, which was included in the 1941 film
Lady Be Good.[10]

By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional
turmoil, becoming unreliable and prompting Rodgers to approach
Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.[11]
Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was
Oklahoma! (1943).[12] Thomas Hischak states, in his The Rodgers and
Hammerstein Encyclopedia, that Oklahoma! is the single most
influential work in the American musical theatre. In fact, the history
of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came
before Oklahoma! and what came after it.[13] An innovation for its
time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, Oklahoma! would
serve, according to Hischak, as the model for Broadway shows for
decades,[13] and proved a huge popular and financial success. Once it
was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge
for the pair. Movie producer Sam Goldwyn saw Oklahoma! and advised
Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers was Sam's blunt
but funny way of telling me that I'd never create another show as good
as Oklahoma![14] As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote,
We're such fools. No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say,
'This is not another Oklahoma!' [15]

Oklahoma! had been a struggle to finance and produce. Hammerstein and
Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner
of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who
together formed what they termed the Gloat Club. At one such
luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that
they turn Molnár's Liliom into a musical. Both men refused—they had no
feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending
was unsuitable for musical theatre.[5] In addition, given the unstable
wartime political situation, they might need to change the setting
from Hungary while in rehearsal.[16] At the next luncheon, Helburn and
Langner again proposed Liliom, suggesting that they move the setting
to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole. Rodgers and Hammerstein played
with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole
dialect, filled with zis and zose would sound corny and would make
it difficult to write effective lyrics.[16]

A breakthrough came when Rodgers, who owned a house in Connecticut,
proposed a New England setting.[17] Hammerstein wrote of this
suggestion in 1945,

I began to see an attractive ensemble—sailors, whalers, girls who
worked in the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an
amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds,
people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been
depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans—a libel I was anxious to
refute ... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage
and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to
Maine than to Budapest. Liliom is, of course, an international
character, indigenous to nowhere.[18]

Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed
the tunnel of Molnár's second act—a series of gloomy scenes leading
up to Liliom's suicide—followed by a dark ending. They also felt it
would be difficult to set Liliom's motivation for the robbery to
music.[16] Molnár's opposition to having his works adapted was also an
issue; he had famously turned down Giacomo Puccini when the great
composer wished to transform Liliom into an opera, stating that he
wanted the piece to be remembered as his, not Puccini's.[5] In 1937,
Molnár, who had recently emigrated to the United States, had declined
another offer from Kurt Weill to adapt the play into a musical.[3]

The pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a Liliom
adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early
1944—writing the film musical State Fair[19] and producing I Remember
Mama on Broadway.[20] Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Molnár to see
Oklahoma! Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt
Liliom as beautifully as they had modified Green Grow the Lilacs into
Oklahoma!, he would be pleased to have them do it.[21] The Guild
obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943. The playwright
received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for personal
services.[22] The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Molnár
permit them to make changes in the plot. At first, the playwright
refused, but eventually yielded. Hammerstein later stated that if this
point had not been won, we could never have made Carousel.[23]

In seeking to establish through song Liliom's motivation for the
robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in
Pal Joey. Rodgers and Hart had overcome the problem with a song that
Joey sings to himself, I'm Talking to My Pal. This inspired
Soliloquy. Both partners later told a story that Soliloquy was
only intended to be a song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that
Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that
Julie might have a girl. However, the notes taken at their meeting of
December 7, 1943 state: Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number
for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father,
in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then
suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely.[24]



The opening carnival scene in Liliom inspired the pantomime that
begins Carousel. 1921 Theatre Guild production.  Hammerstein and
Rodgers returned to the Liliom project in mid-1944. Hammerstein was
uneasy as he worked, fearing that no matter what they did, Molnár
would disapprove of the results.[15] Green Grow the Lilacs had been a
little-known work; Liliom was a theatrical standard. Molnár's text
also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of
1909 and the rigidity of that society. A dismissed carnival barker who
hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an
unlikely central character for a musical comedy.[3] Hammerstein
decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize
with the lovers. He also built up the secondary couple, who are
incidental to the plot in Liliom; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie
Pipperidge.[25] This Was a Real Nice Clambake was repurposed from a
song, A Real Nice Hayride, written for Oklahoma! but not used.[26]

Molnár's ending was unsuitable, and after a couple of false starts,
Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the
musical. According to Frederick Nolan in his book on the team's works:
From that scene the song You'll Never Walk Alone sprang almost
naturally.[27] In spite of Hammerstein's simple lyrics for You'll
Never Walk Alone, Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to
music.[28] Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending,

Liliom was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other
people. The way Molnár wrote it, the man ends up hitting his daughter
and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless
and hopeless. We couldn't accept that. The way we ended Carousel it
may still be a tragedy but it's a hopeful one because in the final
scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express
herself and communicate with others.[29]

When the pair decided to make This Was a Real Nice Clambake into an
ensemble number, Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake
was like, and researched the matter. Based on his initial findings, he
wrote the line, First came codfish chowder. However, further
research convinced him the proper term was codhead chowder, a term
unfamiliar to many playgoers. He decided to keep it as codfish. When
the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast,
Hammerstein wrote the line We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em
good. He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always
slit down the front. The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood
restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the
back. Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which
side of a lobster is the back. One error not caught involved the song
June Is Bustin' Out All Over, in which sheep are depicted as seeking
to mate in late spring—they actually do so in the winter. Whenever
this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant
that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.[30]

Rodgers early decided to dispense with an overture, feeling that the
music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled
themselves.[31] In his autobiography, Rodgers complained that only the
brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never
enough strings in a musical's small orchestra. He determined to force
the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a
pantomime scene accompanied by what became known as The Carousel
Waltz.[32] The pantomime paralleled one in the Molnár play, which was
also used to introduce the characters and situation to the
audience.[33] Author Ethan Mordden described the effectiveness of this
opening:

Other characters catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill
owner, Mrs. Mullin, the widow who runs the carousel and, apparently,
Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. But what draws us in is the
intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen,
staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the
rhythm of Billy's spiel. And as Julie and Billy ride together on the
swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of
the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain
falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and
the opening number but the exposition as well. They have plunged into
the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first
scene any musical ever had.[34]

Casting and tryouts[edit] The casting for Carousel began when
Oklahoma!'s production team, including Rodgers and Hammerstein, was
seeking a replacement for the part of Curly (the male lead in
Oklahoma!). Lawrence Langner had heard, through a relative, of a
California singer named John Raitt, who might be suitable for the
part. Langner went to hear Raitt, then urged the others to bring Raitt
to New York for an audition. Raitt asked to sing Largo al factotum,
Figaro's song from The Barber of Seville, to warm up. The warmup was
sufficient to convince the producers that not only had they found a
Curly, they had found a Liliom (or Billy Bigelow, as the part was
renamed).[35] Theresa Helburn made another California discovery, Jan
Clayton, a singer/actress who had made a few minor films for MGM. She
was brought east and successfully auditioned for the part of
Julie.[27]

The producers sought to cast unknowns. Though many had played in
previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works, only one, Jean Casto (cast as
carousel owner Mrs. Mullin, and a veteran of Pal Joey), had ever
played on Broadway before.[27] It proved harder to cast the ensemble
than the leads, due to the war—Rodgers told his casting director, John
Fearnley, that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be
alive.[36] Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative
team that had made Oklahoma! a success, including director Rouben
Mamoulian and choreographer Agnes de Mille. Miles White was the
costume designer while Jo Mielziner (who had not worked on Oklahoma!)
was the scenic and lighting designer. Even though Oklahoma!
orchestrator Russell Bennett had informed Rodgers that he was
unavailable to work on Carousel due to a radio contract, Rodgers
insisted he do the work in his spare time. He orchestrated The
Carousel Waltz and (When I Marry) Mister Snow before finally being
replaced by Don Walker.[37] A new member of the creative team was
Trude Rittmann, who arranged the dance music. Rittmann initially felt
that Rodgers mistrusted her because she was a woman, and found him
difficult to work with, but the two worked together on Rodgers' shows
until the 1970s.[33]



Oscar Hammerstein II Rehearsals began in January 1945;[3] either
Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present.[38] Raitt was presented
with the lyrics for Soliloquy on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the
piece ran nearly eight minutes. Staging such a long solo number
presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he felt that they were
never fully addressed.[39] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár
came to see what they had done to his play. There are a number of
variations on the story.[35][40] As Rodgers told it, while watching
rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár in the rear
of the theatre and whispered the news to his partner. Both sweated
through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go
right. At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre,
expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. Instead, the playwright said
enthusiastically, What you have done is so beautiful. And you know
what I like best? The ending![41] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár
became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.[18]

Like most of the pair's works, Carousel contains a lengthy ballet,
Billy Makes a Journey,[42] in the second act, as Billy looks down to
the Earth from Up There and observes his daughter. In the original
production the ballet was choreographed by de Mille.[43] As originally
written, de Mille's ballet lasted an hour and fifteen minutes. It
began with Billy looking down from heaven at his wife in labor, with
the village women gathered for a birthing. The ballet involved every
character in the play, some of whom spoke lines of dialogue, and
contained a number of subplots. The focus was on Louise, played by
Bambi Linn, who at first almost soars in her dance, expressing the
innocence of childhood. She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates,
and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people, who
symbolize Billy's world. A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce
Louise, as she discovers her own sexuality, but he decides she is more
girl than woman, and he leaves her. After Julie comforts her, Louise
goes to a children's party, where she is shunned. The carnival people
reappear and form a ring around the children's party, with Louise lost
between the two groups. At the end, the performers form a huge
carousel with their bodies.[44]

The play opened for tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22,
1945. The first act was well-received; the second act was not.[45]
Casto recalled that the second act finished about 1:30 a.m.[27] The
staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. Five scenes,
half a ballet and two songs were cut from the show as the result. John
Fearnley commented, Now I see why these people have hits. I never
witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life.[45] De Mille said
of this conference, not three minutes had been wasted pleading for
something cherished. Nor was there any idle joking. ... We cut and cut
and cut and then we went to bed.[46] By the time the company left New
Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.[44]

A major concern with the second act was the effectiveness of the
characters He and She (later called by Rodgers Mr. and
Mrs. God),[47] before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and
Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in
their parlor.[39][48] The couple was still part of the show at the
Boston opening.[39] Rodgers said to Hammerstein, We've got to get God
out of that parlor. When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the
deity, Rodgers replied, I don't care where you put Him. Put Him on a
ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor! Hammerstein
duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder,[49] and
Mrs. God was removed from the show.[39] Rodgers biographer Meryle
Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic
afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as a
Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but
escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth.[39]

Hammerstein wrote that Molnár's advice, to combine two scenes into
one, was key to pulling together the second act and represented a
more radical departure from the original than any change we had
made.[18] A reprise of If I Loved You was added in the second act,
which Rodgers felt needed more music.[50] Three weeks of tryouts in
Boston followed the brief New Haven run, and the audience there gave
the musical a warm reception.[45] An even shorter version of the
ballet was presented the final two weeks in Boston, but on the final
night there, de Mille expanded it back to forty minutes, and it
brought the house down, causing both Rodgers and Hammerstein to
embrace her.[44]

Synopsis[edit] Act 1[edit] Two young female millworkers in 1873 Maine
visit the town's carousel after work. One of them, Julie Jordan,
attracts the attention of the barker, Billy Bigelow (The Carousel
Waltz). When Julie lets Billy put his arm around her during the ride,
Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to
return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with
Mrs. Mullin. Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous,
mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie
to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie
presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive
(You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman
Enoch Snow ((When I Marry) Mister Snow), to whom she is newly
engaged. Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that
staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of
the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort
Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and
Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but
neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each
other (If I Loved You).



Enoch (Eric Mattson) arrives unexpectedly (reprise of (When I Marry)
Mister Snow). Iva Withers is Julie (standing), and Margot Moser is
Carrie (bent over) (1947).  Over a month passes, and preparations for
the summer clambake are under way (June Is Bustin' Out All
Over). Julie and Billy, now married, live at Julie's cousin Nettie's
spa. Julie confides in Carrie that Billy, frustrated over being
unemployed, hit her. Carrie has happier news—she is engaged to Enoch,
who enters as she discusses him ((When I Marry) Mister Snow
(reprise)). Billy arrives with his ne'er-do-well whaler friend,
Jigger. The former barker is openly rude to Enoch and Julie, then
leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie. Enoch tells Carrie
that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large
family, larger perhaps than Carrie is comfortable having (When the
Children Are Asleep).

Jigger and his shipmates, joined by Billy, then sing about life on the
sea (Blow High, Blow Low). The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help
with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim—Julie's former boss,
Mr. Bascombe—might have to be killed. Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to
tempt Billy back to the carousel (and to her). He would have to
abandon Julie; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension
as one who is single. Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives
and the others leave. She tells him that she is pregnant, and Billy is
overwhelmed with happiness, ending all thoughts of returning to the
carousel. Once alone, Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill
Jr.—until he realizes that his child might be a girl, and reflects
soberly that you've got to be a father to a girl
(Soliloquy). Determined to provide financially for his future child,
whatever the means, Billy decides to be Jigger's accomplice.

The whole town leaves for the clambake. Billy, who had earlier refused
to go, agrees to join in, to Julie's delight, as he realizes that
being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jigger's alibi (Act
I Finale).

Act 2[edit]


What's the Use of Wond'rin' . Withers is Julie (1947).  Everyone
reminisces about the huge meal and much fun (This Was a Real Nice
Clambake). Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks in at the wrong
moment, and declares that he is finished with her (Geraniums In the
Winder), as Jigger jeers (There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman). The
girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that
he's your feller and you love him (What's the Use of
Wond'rin'?). Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and,
trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. She begs him
to give it to her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.

As they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards. They stake their
shares of the anticipated robbery spoils. Billy loses: his
participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger,
Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mill's
money. The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger
escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in
time for him to say his last words to her and die. Julie strokes his
hair, finally able to tell him that she loved him. Carrie and Enoch,
reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and
gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair (You'll
Never Walk Alone).

Billy's defiant spirit (The Highest Judge of All) is taken Up There
to see the Starkeeper, a heavenly official. The Starkeeper tells Billy
that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven, but so
long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a
day to try to do good to redeem himself. He informs Billy that fifteen
years have passed on Earth since the former barker's suicide, and
suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his
daughter, Louise. He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her
(instrumental ballet: Billy Makes a Journey). Louise has grown up to
be lonely and bitter. The local children ostracize her because her
father was a thief and a wife-beater. In the dance, a young ruffian,
much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as
too young. The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to
Earth and help his daughter. He steals a star to take with him, as the
Starkeeper pretends not to notice.

Outside Julie's cottage, Carrie describes her visit to New York with
the now-wealthy Enoch. Carrie's husband and their many children enter
to fetch her—the family must get ready for the high school graduation
later that day. Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind to talk with
Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter,
invisible to the other characters. Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that
she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe. He says that he
will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an
unsuitable match. Louise is outraged: each insults the other's father,
and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away. Billy, able to make himself
visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to
be a friend of her father. He offers her a gift—the star he stole from
heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. He makes
himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that
the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie
understands her perfectly. Louise retreats to the house, as Julie
notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel
Billy's presence (If I Loved You (Reprise)).

Billy invisibly attends Louise's graduation, hoping for one last
chance to help his daughter and redeem himself. The beloved town
physician, Dr. Seldon (who resembles the Starkeeper) advises the
graduating class not to rely on their parents' success or be held back
by their failure (words directed at Louise). Seldon prompts everyone
to sing an old song, You'll Never Walk Alone. Billy, still
invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldon's words,
and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns she
does not have to be an outcast. Billy goes to Julie, telling her at
last that he loved her. As his widow and daughter join in the singing,
Billy is taken to his heavenly reward.

Eleven year old diabetic Skunk (Eloise Laurence) lives with her father
Archie (Tim Roth), her elder brother Jed (Bill Milner), and au pair
Kasia (Zana Marjanović) in a typical British suburb. One of her few
friends is Rick (Robert Emms), a strange young man living with his
parents in the neighbourhood.

Skunk is shocked when Rick gets beaten up by Mr. Oswald (Rory
Kinnear), another neighbour: one of Mr. Oswald's daughters has accused
Rick of rape then later says that Mike is the father of her unborn
child. From that time onwards Skunk's life goes downhill. Kasia splits
up with her boyfriend Mike (Cillian Murphy), who is also Skunk's
favourite teacher. Rick is put into a closed ward as he isolates
himself more and more. Archie and Kasia are beginning a
relationship. Mr. Oswald's daughters start bullying Skunk when the new
term starts. Skunk's first boyfriend suddenly has to move to his
aunt's, something he didn't dare tell her until the day before he
leaves.

Skunk secretly visits Rick when he spends his first weekend at home
again. When she enters the house, she finds that Rick has pushed his
mother down the stairs, breaking her neck, and knocked out his
father. Rick does not let Skunk leave and does not realise when Skunk,
deprived of her medical supply, falls into a hyperglycemic
shock. Mr. Oswald finds Skunk and saves her. In a dream sequence Skunk
bids farewell to people from her childhood. She wakes up in a hospital
bed, with her father at her bedside.

All I Want Is You is a song by Swedish recording artist Agnes. The
song was written by Agnes, Ana Diaz, and Jonas Quant. The latter
produced the song for Agnes' fourth studio album, Veritas (2012). The
song received its radio debut on Sveriges Radio P3 on August 29.[1] It
was released as the second single from the album on August 31,
2012.[2]

Background[edit] On July 2012, Agnes debuted the song at her
performance at Stockholm Pride.[3] On August 27, 2012, Agnes revealed
the release date and artwork for the single.[2] The single was sent to
radio stations across Sweden on August 29, one week before the release
of her fourth studio album Veritas.[4] The same day blogger Perez
Hilton premiered the lyrics video of the song exclusively on his
website and commenting it with Agnes Doesn't Want Much… All She Wants
Is You! And all WE want it more Agnes! Seems like a fair trade to
us![5] Agnes has self stated that All I Want Is You is feverish,
and ambiguous, perhaps a declaration of love, but equally a story of
obsession.[6]

Music video[edit] A lyric video for the song was released on Agnes
official YouTube page on 30 August 2012.[7]

UK blogger, Scandipop, compared the tune with her previous hit
Release Me saying that those who wanted something similar to that
era will be pleased to learn All I Want Is You is a respectful nod
back to that sound. Dancepop, with a heavy emphasis on the strings.
However he admitted that the sound of the single evolved the
appropriate way for the last four years, and he paided homage to
producer Jonas Quant, who wrote the song along with Ana Diaz and Agnes
herself, for this.[9] JonAli described the song as an emotional disco
anthem with lush strings and a flawless vocal from the Swedish diva.
All I Want Is You” brings us back to the friendly dance beats we are
use [sic] to hearing from her hits 'Release Me' and 'Don’t Go Breaking
My Heart'.[10]

CVSup is a computer program written for Unix/Linux based systems that
synchronizes files and directories from one location to another while
minimizing data transfer using file-type specific delta encoding when
appropriate. CVSup was designed for keeping source code repositories -
such as CVS - synchronized, but has been extended to support
synchronizing any type of file.

In some manners, CVSup operates similarly to the rsync program, with
some notable differences. CVSup attempts to balance data transfer in
each direction,[clarification needed] rather than most of the data
being transferred from the server to the client. It attempts to
balance CPU and disk utilization server to the client.[clarification
needed] It also uses delta algorithms specific to the file being
synchronized. For example, files within a CVS repository extend and
grow in a particular way. CVSup, when it recognizes a CVS file, will
adapt its algorithm to take advantage of this and reduce the amount of
data transferred. Many other types of files have specific support, and
a generic algorithm is used where no specific support exists. CVSup
will only 'pull' data from the remote server.

CVSup can use the .zlib compression package to compress all
transferred data. CVSup, written in the Modula-3 programming language,
was conceived and developed by John Polstra.

debut album in August 1989 and finished in December of the same
year.[4] In 1990, En Vogue released their first single Hold On,
which became a number one single. Later that year, the group released
their debut album Born to Sing, which sold a million copies. The group
released their multi-platinum second album Funky Divas in 1992. Jones
sang lead vocals on the album's top charting singles including My
Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It), Give It Up, Turn It Loose, and
Free Your Mind, which remain one of their signature songs. Free
Your Mind won two MTV Video Music Awards for Best R&B Video and
Best Dance Video.

In 1997, En Vogue released their third album, EV3. In 2000, they
released their fourth album, Masterpiece Theatre. The following year,
Jones left En Vogue to focus on family and was replaced by Amanda
Cole. In 2003, she returned after Cole left the group on maternity
leave. After touring with En Vogue in 2003, Jones left the group
again. After the release of En Vogue's fifth album, Jones returned to
the group. Following the next six years, Jones would perform with En
Vogue.

2011-2013: En Vogue to the Max and lawsuit[edit] On September 26,
2011, Ellis, Jones & Herron without Robinson, debuted their new single
I'll Cry Later from their forthcoming album that was planned for a
December release. Negotiations for the album release resulted in Jones
leaving En Vogue which was discussed with Robinson on Access Hollywood
nearly a year later on October 17, 2012.[5] The following year, Jones
and former-fellow group member Dawn Robinson created their own group
Heirs to the Throne. The group performed at several venues before
departing on good terms. In 2013, Jones began her own line-up of En
Vogue. The group debut as En Vogue to the Max.[6][7][8] It was also
soon announced that Ellis and Herron sued Jones for use of the En
Vogue name. A judge ruled that Herron and Ellis, as holders of the
group's LLC, had exclusive rights to the group's name. Herron and
Ellis also filed suit against Jones, demanding $1 million for
unauthorized use of the name, though the damages request was
ultimately determined to be without merit, as Herron and Ellis could
not demonstrate harm done to the company from Jones's use of the
name.[9] She also appeared as a judge in season two's Paramount Idol,
alongside Bruce Flohr and Andy Waldeck.[10]

2014-present: Do You See Me Now and present[edit] In 2014, Jones began
recording her first solo album entitled, Do You See Me Now.[3] Jones
also confirmed to release the lead single Didn't I on May 15,
2014.[3] Following the release of her album, Jones will embarked on
her To the Max tour.[3]

Personal life[edit] Jones and her sisters have a general goods
business. She currently resides in Charlottesville with her
daughter. Her sister Rose Hill, who is a well known artist also
resides in Charlottesville.[citation needed] She still remains best
friends with Dawn Robinson.


Stylebase for Eclipse is a free, open source tool for software
architects and designers. The tool is an extension to Eclipse, the
most widely used open source integrated development
environment. Stylebase is a knowledge base of architectural models,
e.g. architectural patterns, design patterns, reference architectures,
macro- and microarchitectures. Stylebase for Eclipse is a tool for
browsing and maintaining the stylebase.

Stylebase for Eclipse assist in quality- and model-driven architecture
design. Quality-driven architecture design relies on the assumption
that architectural patterns and styles, and also design patterns,
embody different quality attributes. When patterns are applied in the
architecture, quality characteristics of the selected patterns are
reflected to the entire software architecture. Stylebase for Eclipse
helps an architect in selecting styles and patterns which best promote
the system's desired quality goals. Stylebase also aims to improve
knowledge sharing and the reuse of architectural models in local and
distributed development teams. Thereby, using the tool is claimed to
increase both the productivity of development teams and quality of
software products.[1]

Stylebase for Eclipse open source community is co-ordinated by VTT
Technical Research Centre of Finland. The tool can be modified and
redistributed under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. The
first version of the tool was published in October 2006 and 4 new
releases have been published since them. Stylebase for Eclipse is in
early phase of its life cycle - the currently available release is
still a Beta version.

The carronade was designed as a short-range naval weapon with a low
muzzle velocity for merchant ships, which found a niche role on
warships. It was produced by the Carron ironworks and at first sold as
a system with the gun, mounting and shot all together. The standard
package of shot per gun was 25 roundshot, 15 barshot, 15 double-headed
shot, 10 single grapeshot and 10 single canister shot. Single
meant the shot weighed the same as the roundshot, some other canister
and grapeshot were also included which weighed one and a half times
the roundshot. The advantages for merchant ships are described in an
advertising pamphlet of 1779.[1] Production of both shot and gun by
the same firm immediately allowed a reduction in the windage, the gap
between the bore of the gun and the diameter of the ball. The
mounting, attached to the side of the ship on a pivot, took the recoil
on a slider. The reduced recoil did not alter the alignment of the
gun. The smaller gunpowder charge reduced the guns' heating in
action. The pamphlet advocated the use of woollen cartridges, which,
although more expensive, eliminated the need for wadding and
worming. Simplifying gunnery for comparatively untrained merchant
seamen in both aim and reloading was part of the rationale for the
gun. The replacement of trunnions by a bolt underneath, to connect the
gun to the mounting, reduced the width of the carriage enhancing the
wide angle of fire. A merchant ship would almost always be running
away from its target, so a wide angle of fire was much more important
than on a warship. A carronade weighed a quarter as much and used a
quarter to a third of the gunpowder charge for a long gun firing the
same cannonball.[2] Its invention is variously ascribed to Lieutenant
General Robert Melville in 1759, or to Charles Gascoigne, manager of
the Carron Company from 1769 to 1779. In its early years the weapon
was sometimes called a mellvinade or alternatively, a
gasconade.[3] The carronade can be seen as the culmination of an
evolutionary process of naval guns reducing the barrel length and
gunpowder charge. The Carron Company was already selling a new
light-constructed gun, two-thirds of the weight of the standard naval
gun and charged with one sixth of the weight of ball in powder before
it introduced the carronade, which further halved the gunpowder
charge.[1]

The reduced charge allowed carronades to have a shorter length and
much lighter weight than long guns. Inside the gun barrel, increasing
the size of the bore, and ball, reduces the required length of
barrel. The force acting on the ball is proportional to the square of
the diameter while the mass of the ball rises by the cube,
acceleration is slower; the barrel can be shorter and therefore
lighter. Long guns were also excessively heavy in comparison to a
carronade because they were over-specified, being capable of being
double shotted whereas to do this in a carronade was dangerous. A ship
could carry more carronades, or carronades of a larger caliber, than
long guns, and carronades could be mounted on the upper decks, where
heavy long guns could cause the ship to be top-heavy and
unstable. Carronades also required a smaller gun crew, which was very
important for merchant ships, and they were faster to reload.

Carronades initially became popular on British merchant ships during
the American Revolutionary War. A lightweight gun that needed only a
small gun crew and was devastating at short range was a weapon well
suited to defending merchant ships against French and American
privateers. In the Action of 4 September 1782, the impact of a single
carronade broadside fired at close range by the frigate HMS Rainbow
under Henry Trollope caused a wounded French captain to capitulate and
surrender the Hebe after a short fight.[4]

The Royal Navy was initially reluctant to adopt the guns, mainly due
to mistrust of the Carron Company, which had developed a reputation
for incompetence and commercial sharp practice.[5] Carronades were not
even counted in numbering the guns of a ship. It was Lord Sandwich who
eventually started mounting them in place of the light guns on the
forecastle and quarterdeck of ships. They soon proved their
effectiveness in battle. French gun foundries were unable to produce
equivalents for twenty years,[5] so carronades gave British warships a
significant tactical advantage during the latter part of the 18th
century — though French ships mounted another type of weapon in the
same role, the obusier de vaisseau. HMS Victory used the two
68-pounder carronades which she carried on her forecastle to great
effect at the Battle of Trafalgar, clearing the gun deck of the
Bucentaure by firing a round shot and a keg of 500 musket balls
through the Bucentaure's stern windows.

The carronade was initially very successful and widely adopted, and a
few experimental ships (for example, HMS Glatton and HMS Rainbow[5])
were fitted with a carronade-only armament. Glatton, a fourth-rate
ship with 56 guns, had a more destructive broadside than HMS Victory,
a first-rate ship with 100 guns. Although Glatton and Rainbow were
both successful in battle, the carronade's lack of range against an
opponent who could keep well clear and still use his long guns was an
arguable tactical disadvantage of this arrangement.

In the 1810s and 1820s, tactics started to place a greater emphasis on
the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a
broadside. Indeed, Captain David Porter of USS Essex complained when
the navy replaced his 12-pounder long guns with 32-pounder
carronades. The carronade disappeared from the Royal Navy from the
1850s after the development of steel-jacketed cannon by William George
Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Carronades were nevertheless still
used in the American Civil War in the 1860s. The last known use of a
carronade in conflict was during the First Boer War. In the siege of
Potchefstroom the Boers used 'Ou Griet', an antique carronade mounted
on a wagon axle, against the British fort.[6]

Design[edit]


Admiralty carriage mount for an 18-pounder carronade, 1808.  The
original design of the carronade included a different type of mounting
on a wooden carriage where the cannon itself had a projecting loop on
the bottom that was pinned to the gun carriage, which was fastened to
the side of the ship, with a pivoting mounting which allowed the gun
to be rotated while rearward recoil was contained, sometimes with a
slider carriage. In some versions a wedge was placed underneath the
chamber to control elevation while in later versions an elevating
screw was used

Carronades had a chamber one caliber smaller than the bore – for
example, an 18-pounder carronade had its chamber bored equal to a
12-pounder. This was partly to reduce the weight of the cannon, but
also had the effect of reducing the velocity of the cannonball and
range to which it could fire, relative to a gun firing the same weight
of shot, and all other things being equal. However, one factor
mitigating the deficiency in range is that carronades could be bored
with a much tighter windage than long guns. This meant that more of
the propellant went to moving the shot, rather than bypassing it.

Naval artillery during the Age of Sail simply was not accurate,
regardless of whether the cannon was a gun or a carronade. Almost all
barrels were smoothbore, not rifled, and tolerances on everything from
the actual roundness and straightness of the barrel and shot size in
relation to the bores (windage) had wide variations. Sights were
rudimentary or non-existent and elevation was controlled by wedges and
guesswork. As a result, effective or decisive naval battles were
generally fought at ranges under 100 yards where the carronade's
heavier ball was useful and its shorter range was not a huge
problem. While technological improvements changed the capabilities of
naval armament by the nineteenth century, muzzle-loading smoothbore
cannon were still not very accurate. As a result, shipborne cannon
counted on the effect of rapid broadsides at short range. The
carronade could make a significant contribution to the weight of a
broadside.

Ordnance[edit]


Diagram of a carronade mounting. The lack of a nozzle or muzzle cup
suggests this carronade pre-dates ca. 1790, and it must date to 1785
or earlier as a copy of this drawing in the Dutch archives bears that
date.


Model of a carronade with grapeshot ammunition A carronade was much
shorter and a third to a quarter of the weight of an equivalent long
gun: a 32-pounder carronade, for example, weighed less than a ton, but
a 32-pounder long gun weighed over 3 tons. Carronades were
manufactured in the usual naval gun sizes: 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 32-, and
42-pounders, and 68-pounder versions are known.

The smaller carronades served in three roles. First, they often
constituted the entire armament of unrated vessels. For instance, the
Ballahoo- and Cuckoo-class schooners were armed only with four
12-pounder carronades. Second, gunboats, such as those that the
Americans deployed at the Battle of Lake Borgne often had one large
18-, 24-, or 32-pounder gun forward on a pivot, and two smaller
carronades aft. Lastly, larger vessels carried a few 12-, 18-, or
24-pounders, to arm their ship's boats — the cutters, pinnaces,
launches, barges, and the like — to give them firepower for boat
actions. For instance, each of the 42 larger British boats at the
Battle of Lake Borgne carried a carronade in its bows; only the three
gigs were unarmed.

At the other end, even a quite small vessel might carry the
68-pounders. For instance, Commander William Layman of the ill-fated
Cruizer-class brig sloop HMS Raven replaced her two forward 6-pounder
guns and 32-pounder carronades with a single 68-pounder on a pivot,
and then did the same with two of the aft 32-pounder carronades. By
doing this he replaced 70 pounds of broadside with 136 pounds
(assuming that both 68-pounders would usually fire on the same side),
and ensured that Raven would have less dead-space to her front and
rear.

Carronades were not counted in a ship of the line's rated number of
guns. The classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can
therefore mislead; they would often be carrying fewer guns but more
pieces of ordnance than they were described as carrying.

Although the carronade, like other naval guns, was mounted with ropes
to restrain the recoil, the details of the gun mounting were usually
quite different. The carronade was typically mounted on a sliding,
rather than wheeled, gun carriage, and elevation was achieved with a
turnscrew, like field guns, rather than the quoins (wooden wedges)
usual for naval guns. In addition, a carronade was usually mounted on
a lug underneath the barrel, rather than the usual trunnions to either
side. As a result, the carronade had an unusually high centre of
gravity. Towards the end of the period of use, some carronades were
fitted with trunnions to lower their centre of gravity, to create a
variant known as the gunnade. Gunnades, introduced around 1820, should
not be confused with the earliest carronades, which also featured
trunnions.



Carronade on a garrison mount, used to defend
fortifications. Government House, Bermuda Range[edit] As a result of
irregularities in the size of cannonballs and the difficulty of boring
out gun barrels, there was usually a considerable gap (known as the
windage) between the ball and the inside of the gun barrel. The
windage of a cannon was often as much as a quarter of an inch and
caused a considerable loss of projectile power. The manufacturing
practices introduced by the Carron Company reduced the windage
considerably. Despite the reduced windage, carronades had a much
shorter range, typically a third to a half, than the equivalent long
gun because they used a much smaller propellant charge (the chamber
for the powder was smaller than the bore for the ball). Typical naval
tactics in the late 18th century, however, emphasised short-range
broadsides, so the range was not thought to be a problem.

The carronade disappeared into history before the science of
aerodynamics started. At the time there was no good theory to account
for the range of cannon. We now know that the air resistance of the
spherical cannonball in supersonic flight is much much greater than in
subsonic flight. For a given weight of powder, a larger ball, having a
large mass, would have a lower maximum velocity which would reduce the
range of supersonic flight. But the increase in the distance of
subsonic flight, as the air resistance is proportional to the square
of the diameter but the mass is proportional to the cube, may have
more than compensated. Carronades were short range because of their
small gunpowder charge but their lower muzzle velocity required a
higher trajectory. But at sea, the range of the long gun had little
use. At sea, guns were on moving platforms making timing of fire,
i.e. aim in the vertical plane, very difficult. Pitch and roll meant
that most ships fought at close range of a few hundred yards or
less. In battles between warships, carronades could be at a
disadvantage, if they were fought outside its point blank range;
however, there is no evidence that any battle was decided outside of
carronade range. Warships often aimed at the enemy’s hull to destroy
its capacity for battle. A ball fired from a cannon, on the downward
roll of the ship, would often ricochet off the sea into the enemy
hull. A merchant ship would more often aim at the bigger target of the
masts and rigging in the hope of escaping a pursuing enemy. The higher
trajectory required for carronades, at ranges of 400 yards or more,
was of little disadvantage for its use by merchant ships or any naval
ship fleeing a more powerful enemy. Theory for centuries had always
associated long barrels with long range but experience had also shown
that shortening the barrel (e.g. the English musket barrel between
1630 and 1660 went down from 4 to 3 feet long[7]) did not reduce
performance as much as expected.


Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet (1676–1758) was an English Tory
politician who represented three constituencies in the 18th century.

Curzon was the son of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 2nd Baronet of Kedleston,
and his wife Sarah Penn daughter of William Penn of Penn,
Buckinghamshire.[1]

Curzon was elected as Member of Parliament for Derby in 1713, but lost
the seat in 1715. He was then elected for Clitheroe in 1722. When his
elder brother died in 1727 he inherited the Baronetcy and the seat at
Derbyshire which he held until 1754.

Curzon married Mary Assheton, daughter of Sir Ralph Assheton, Bt of
Middleton Lancashire. His elder son Nathaniel succeeded to the
baronetcy and became Lord Scarsdale. His second son Assheton Curzon,
became Viscount Curzon.

Carolina Highway 108 is a 22 miles (35 km) long, two lane highway in
North Carolina, USA. It connects U.S. 176 in Tryon to Rutherfordton
and passes through both Polk County and Rutherford County. It is a
rural country road through eastern Polk County and western Rutherford
County, and moderately developed from Tryon through Columbus and in
Rutherfordton. It is also known as Lynn Road between Tryon and
Columbus, Mills Street through Columbus, and Tryon Road in Rutherford
County.

Route description[edit]


Roundabout on the west side of the N.C. 108 bridge over I-26 in
Columbus.  N.C. 108 begins at U.S. 176 in Tryon and travels east
through the unincorporated town of Lynn, where it crosses the Pacolet
River. N.C. 108 has an interchange with I-26 and U.S. 74 in Columbus,
and another interchange with U.S. 74 east of Columbus. N.C. 108 passes
through the center of Columbus, the seat of Polk County, which is the
most developed portion of the route in Polk County. Three miles east
of the second U.S. 74 interchange, N.C. 108 intersects North Carolina
Highway 9 at the unincorporated town of Mill Spring. The section from
Tryon to Mill Spring closely follows the front range of the Blue Ridge
Mountains. It passes over the Green River in Polk County and the Broad
River in Rutherford County. N.C. 108 ends 6.5 miles past the Polk
County and Rutherford County line at Washington Street in
Rutherfordton.

N.C. 108 is unique for having two roundabouts at the I-26/U.S. 74
interchange. These were constructed between 2004 and 2007 to improve
the level of service at the interchange.

Future[edit] Widening of N.C. 108 to four lanes with a median and
limited turn lanes near I-26 in Columbus is included as part of North
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) State Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP) project I-4729. This project includes
making the I-26/U.S. 74 interchange a full interchange with access
ramps from I-26 westbound to U.S. 74 eastbound and U.S. 74 westbound
to I-26 eastbound. Currently, the partial interchange between the two
freeways requires traffic to use N.C. 108 for access from I-26 west to
U.S. 74 east and U.S. 74 west to I-26 east. The construction of the
roundabouts was meant as a temporary fix to alleviate congestion at
the interchange until funding for this project is available. It is
currently unfunded in the 2009-2015 TIP,[1] and is not included in the
Draft 2012-2018 STIP.[2] It is scheduled for reprioritization in 2012,
and will be considered for the 2018-2022 developmental STIP. The
project was not included in the Draft 2012-2018 STIP because NCDOT
Division 14's funding allocation has been assigned to other
projects. Funding allocations may change before the Final 2012-2018
STIP is approved in 2011. The estimated project cost is $20.3
million.[3]

The Comprehensive Transportation Plan Study Report for Polk County,
completed in October 2008 by the Transportation Planning Branch of the
NCDOT, recommends upgrading N.C. 108 in the future to a four-lane,
divided facility from its western terminus at U.S. 176 in Tryon to the
U.S. 74 interchange east of Columbus.[4]


George Barret, Jr. (1767, London - 1842, Paddington) was an English
landscape painter, and a son of the Irish artist George Barret, Sr.

Almost certainly taught by his father, he exhibited at the Royal
Academy from 1800-1803. He was an early member of the Society of
Painters in Water Colours when it was founded in 1804, and exhibited
prolifically, never missing an exhibition for 38 years. Little is
known of his early years, except that in 1767 he was born in Orchard
Street in London, off Portman Square, where his father lived after
moving from his native Ireland. George Barret was seventeen when he
and his brothers and sisters were left fatherless, and had to support
themselves by their own efforts. Three of them, beside himself, took
to the practice of art, but George was by far the most gifted
artistically.

His earlier works were views of the Thames Valley and Home Counties
and a few of Wales, but he increasingly turned to romantic
compositions of a Claudian type showing poetic sunrises and sunsets
without reference to locality. A truly visionary painter, his artistic
power remained unimpaired to the last, even though his life was one
long struggle against financial ruin.

He lived most of his life in Paddington, where he died on 19 March
1842. He was buried in the ancient churchyard of St. Mary's,
Paddington.


History[edit] The first overseer was T.G. Bavin for the village of
Hafford in 1914. The Hafford Village Council and Board of Trade
requested a doctor, and Dr. Whitemarsh was appointed for the
village. The early community was first served by Luxembourg Post
Office. The early village had three lumber yards, a general store,
I.H.C. agency, a poolroom, livery barn, hardware, and post office. In
1913 the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the first restaurant
opened. The hotel and bar were established in 1914. Power came to
Hafford in 1916, and the Hafford Rural Telephone Company was
established in 1916. The Hafford hospital was built in 1922. Hafford
was served by the Ukrainian Catholic Church established 1911, the
Ukrainian Orthodox church built 1909, the Roman Catholic Church
erected about the same time. The Anglican church was built in 1918,
and the Methodist church which was erected in Hafford moved to
Richard.[1]


Education[edit] The Hafford community was served firstly by the
Whiteberry School District which constructed their school building
over two years 1906-1908, opening in 1909 followed by the Rus School
District opening 1910. In this area, the Alberton School District,
Gooseberry School District, Slawa School District and the Craigmore
School District were all organised in 1912. The Hafford School
District and Nauka School Districts were organised in 1914, Langley
School District 1916, and both the Lost Lake School District, and the
Canada School District in 1918.[1]

Transportation[edit] Historically, the railroad connecting Prince
Albert and North Battleford was laid in 1913, and upon the rail line,
a site was chosen for the village of Hafford site.[1] The community is
served by Hafford Airport which is located 1 nautical mile (1.9 km)
northwest and the Carlton Trail Railway that runs parallel to Highway
40.

Notable people[edit] Sonia Scurfield, the second woman (and the only
Canadian woman) to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup Allen

Diamond Jubilee Medal from Prime Minister Stephen Harper for her
contribution to entrepreneurship in Canada which launched 5,000 new
businesses creating over 20,000 new jobs as the CEO of The Canadian
Youth Business Foundation (CYBF), and for her international work as
the Founder of the G20 Young Entrepreneur Alliance (G20YEA).  Notable
features[edit] The Dominion Government Illustration Station was
operated between 1932-1955. This station tested grains, and
fertilizers and improved livestock.[1]


Career[edit] Kunder studied electronics and communications engineering
from SDM College of Engineering and Technology in Dharwad, Karnataka
and worked for Motorola. He later entered the film industry as an
editor, edited the movie Champion (2000).[citation needed] The editing
of Farah Khan's Main Hoon Na in 2004 brought him fame.

Kunder then turned to directing. His directorial debut was titled
Jaan-E-Mann. Apart from editing and composing the background music
score. he also wrote the story, screenplay and dialogues. The film
starred Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Preity Zinta, and was released
on 20 October 2006. The film was a commercial failure. He has worked
on Tees Maar Khan his wife's 3rd directorial venture. The film was
panned by critics but was declared a semi-hit at the box office.

Personal life[edit] On 9 December 2004, Kunder married director and
choreographer Farah Khan, who is eight years his senior. She gave
birth to their triplets, son Czar and daughters Diva and Anya, on 11
February 2008 at Mumbai's Jaslok hospital.


Postgraduate training in general dentistry in the United States From
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Contents [hide] 1 Program details 2
Application process 3 State licensure 4 Program examples 5 References
There are two forms of institution-based training for general
dentistry available for dental school graduates in the United States:

General practice residency (GPR) Advanced education in general
dentistry (AEGD) Program details[edit] Both GPRs and AEGDs can be
1-year programs with an option available to continue for a second year
or they may be a two-year program from the start. They allow the new
dentist to further hone his or her skills in most of the traditionally
defined disciplines of dentistry while at the same time increasing
one's speed and refining one's techniques. These programs also afford
trainees the opportunity to learn from the attending dentists who
serve a supervisory role, something generally unavailable in private
practice.

While a GPR is a hospital-based program, an AEGD is usually not and
the differences between the two types of programs are generally a
result of this distinction.[1] Both types of programs afford the
trainee with a larger patient pool than he or she was exposed to in
dental school; while dental students will typically treat 2 or 3
patients a day in multiple-hour-long sessions, these postgraduate
programs are constructed so that trainees may see anywhere from 8-15
patients a day, or even more.

Programs will often emphasize the importance of managing comprehensive
dental treatment plans and adjusting them based on the patient's
medical condition. During training, residents may be faced with the
task of managing patients that require dentistry in a hospital setting
due to a compromised medical condition. Medical management of dental
patients may be emphasized in weekly grand rounds and rotations
through anesthesia, internal medicine, and the hospital emergency
department. Some programs also provide rotations in family medicine
and otolarnyology.

These rotations not only increase the trainee's knowledge and
experience, but also allows physicians, resident or attending, to see
how dentistry and medicine are related, allowing for a better referral
relationship in future practices. This relationship is best
demonstrated in tumor boards where both medical and dental residents
discuss and treatment plan head and neck cancer patients.

In general, GPR programs pay higher stipends than do AEGD programs;
this is because GPR residents take call and answer consults. While on
call, the residents are expected to manage head and neck trauma
reporting to the ER in accordance with hospital guidelines.

GPR residents may also become familiar with performing dental/oral
surgical procedures in the operating room and managing the patient's
stay while in the hospital. Rotation through the dental specialties
increases the resident's ability to handle situations in private
practice without referral to a specialist.

In both programs, the basic skills learned in dental school are
improved significantly, preparing the dentist for a career in private
practice or for a specialty residency program. Residents may work
closely with oral and maxillofacial surgeons, allowing them to improve
their skills in oral surgical procedures. Under the direct supervision
of the oral surgeons, residents may expand their understanding of and
increase their skill in third molar extraction, biopsy technique,
pathology recognition and treatment planning in facial cosmetic and
trauma surgery. Both types of programs will usually feature lecture
series to further develop the knowledge that trainees received from
their respective dental schools.

Application process[edit] Applications are generally filled out at the
beginning of the senior year of dental school. As with most specialty
programs, GPR and AEGD programs utilize the Postdoctoral Application
Support Service (PASS) operated and managed by the American Dental
Education Association (ADEA). The PASS system allows all applicants to
fill out a single form that is then efficiently distributed to the
programs selected by the applicant. Similarly, single copies of
secondary application material, such as letters of recommendation,
National Board scores and the like, can be sent to PASS, which then
certifies the authenticity of the copied versions it distributes to
the selected programs. Overall, it allows for a more streamlined
process of application over most any aternative method.[2]

After applications are in, programs will usually contact prospective
candidates for interviews. After interviews are complete, the programs
and the candidates will utilize the Postdoctoral Dental Matching
Program, abbreviated as the Match, to rank each other in order of
preference. After the due date, a computerized algorithm sets up each
candidate with the program that he or she ranked highest, although
this explanation is overly simplified. For those candidates who do not
match at any program, there is a post-match period during which
programs which maintain open spots attempt to fill them on a
case-by-case basis with candidates who did not match to a program.[3]

State licensure[edit] Some states require a postgraduate training
program to meet requirements for licensure. For example, as of January
1, 2007, New York State requires that new dentists complete either a
GPR, an AEGD or a specialty residency prior to receiving their dental
license.[4]

Baseball career[edit] Playing career[edit] As a player, Smith was
primarily a second baseman and shortstop, though he played a few games
at third base and even made one appearance as a pitcher. He played in
the San Diego Padres organization from 1976 to 1982, playing for the
Single-A Walla Walla Padres and Reno Silver Sox, the Double-A Amarillo
Gold Sox, and the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders. Smith played over three
seasons at Triple-A Hawaii, but was never called up by the major
league club. His playing career ended after the 1982 season at the age
of 28.

Coaching career[edit] From 1983 to 1989, Smith managed the Single-A
Salem Redbirds, Miami Marlins, and Reno Padres, the Double-A Beaumont
Golden Gators and Wichita Pilots, and the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars,
all of which were Padres affiliates at the time he managed them. He
then spent the 1990 season managing the Double-A Oklahoma City 89ers
in the Texas Rangers organization. Smith then went to the Seattle
Mariners organization, managing the Single-A Advanced Peninsula Pilots
in 1991, the Triple-A Calgary Cannons in 1994, and the Triple-A Tacoma
Rainiers in 1995.

Smith became a major league coach for the Mariners in 1996 and held a
coaching position with the club until 1999. He then returned to the
minor leagues in 2000, managing the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians of
the Milwaukee Brewers organization. He returned to major league
coaching in 2002 when he became the third-base coach for the Texas
Rangers, a position he held until 2006. In 2007 he became the
Philadelphia Phillies third-base coach, and won a World Series ring
with the team in 2008. The Phillies dismissed him after the 2008
season.[1]

Smith was named to his position as infield and third base coach with
the Cleveland Indians on November 16, 2009.[2]

Smith will be the Cincinnati Reds third base coach starting in the
2014 season.[3]

Personal life and other media[edit] Smith lives in Encinitas,
California. He, along with his daughter Allison, competed in the
sixteenth season of the CBS reality program The Amazing Race. Steve
and Allie finished in sixth place and were eliminated in the April 4,
2010, episode at the pit stop in Malaysia.

College and Amateur[edit] Kouadio moved from his native Côte d'Ivoire
to the United States as a teenager, settling in Woodlyn,
Pennsylvania. He played four years of college soccer at the University
of Vermont, where he was named America East Striker of the Year and
Rookie of the Year in his freshman year.[1]

During his college years he also played with the Cape Cod Crusaders in
the USL Premier Development League.

Professional[edit] After briefly trialling with the NSC Minnesota
Stars during the early part of 2010, during which he played in several
pre-season scrimmages,[2] Kouadio signed with the Pittsburgh
Riverhounds of the USL Second Division. He made his professional debut
on May 14, 2010 in a game against the Charlotte Eagles.[3]


Fin Cop is a hill and an associated Iron Age hill fort in Monsal Dale,
close to Ashford in the Water in Derbyshire, England.[2]

The fort shows evidence of hurried construction, indicating a
defensive response to a real threat, rather than the more usual
assumption that such forts were a display of status and prestige.[2]
The hillfort, along with an adjacent bowl barrow, lime kiln and
quarry, constitutes a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[3]

Recent excavations have unearthed a mass burial containing only women
and children, the first such segregated burial in Iron Age Britain

Philip Donnellan (9 February 1924 – 15 February 1999) was an English
documentary film-maker.

Described in his Guardian obituary as one of the greatest of all
documentarists, Donnellan worked with the BBC for over four decades,
producing around 80 documentary films and programmes, most reflecting
working-class lives.

The son of an Irish headmaster, Donnellan grew up in Surrey. After
World War II, in which he fought in Burma, he became a journalist,
then a BBC radio announcer. He began interviewing working people, such
as the fisherman Sam Larner, who had a vast repertoire of traditional
songs. The two programmes Donnellan made for the BBC of these songs
introduced them to Ewan MacColl.

From there, Donnellan diversified into television, focusing on working
people; his first film was Joe The Chainsmith, and his 1962 Private
Faces was a portrait of a Durham miner. He also filmed public figures
such as Konrad Adenauer, Jawaharlal Nehru and Charles de Gaulle; these
were well received but he found them less satisfying. His continual
addressing of political issues led to many editorial disputes, but
Donnellan kept his film-making base at Pebble Mill in Birmingham,
which meant he could present his films to the BBC controllers as faits
accomplis.

Donnellan continued to be entertaining and provocative: Where Do We Go
From Here? dealt with the question of the 'Gypsy menace' (travelling
people), Gone For A Soldier (1980) was a 105-minute montage of
ordinary soldiers' diaries and letters, and he made film versions of
the radio ballads Shoals Of Herring (1972), The Fight Game and The Big
Hewer (1973) with MacColl and Peggy Seeger. He co-founded and chaired
the West Midlands Gypsy Liaison Group.

Plot[edit] Two female vice-unit detectives — the calm and professional
Detective Amy Devlin (Evison) and her hotheaded partner, Detective
Taylor Lucas (McLellan), a former special agent for the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — are investigating the
murder of local pimp Milton Wilder and uncover a conspiracy by four
corrupt female police officers who murder felons (including Wilder and
Laurette Stipe, a bail-jumping gunrunner biker Devlin and Taylor were
pursuing) to harvest their organs for the most-seriously-ill patients
using the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP) DNA database
of felons and the organ-donor registry.

Production[edit] The episode was written by Lee Goldberg and William
Rabkin; it was directed by Bruce Seth Green.

Pilot[edit] Goldberg and Rabkin were also the executive producers of
the series and would have been the executive producers on the new
series as well.[2] They, along with Green, had worked extensively with
Evison before on seaQuest DSV (1993–1996), a science-fiction
television series in the United States. She also guest-starred as
different characters in two earlier episodes of Diagnosis Murder
('Murder by the Busload' and 'Wrong Number') that were written and/or
produced Goldberg & Rabkin prior to the nested pilot.

Because Diagnosis: Murder was itself a spin-off of the television
series Jake and the Fatman (1987–1992) which was a spin-off of the
television series Matlock (1986–1995), Fred Silverman, another
executive producer of the series, insisted that every season the
series devote one episode to be a nested pilot. This was a practice he
had earlier pioneered at CBS where episodes of Barnaby Jones
(1973–1980), Magnum, P.I. (1980–1988) and others often hosted such
pilots.

The two nested-pilot projects during Goldberg's and Rabkin's period
with the series were A Mime Is a Terrible Thing to Waste (1997),
which was an unsold pilot for a spin-off with no name currently known;
and a two-part episode Retribution (1998), which was for a spin-off
called The Chief and would have starred Fred Dryer.[3]

Previous nested-pilot episodes of the series included Sister Michael
Wants You (1994), with Delta Burke as a crime-solving nun; How to
Murder Your Lawyer (1995), about crime-solving lawyers; and An
Explosive Murder (1996), starring Tracy Gold as an undercover police
officer. [1]

Dane Hogan (born 3 July 1989 in Brisbane, Queensland) is a
professional rugby league footballer, who currently plays for North
Queensland Cowboys in the National Rugby League (NRL). He plays
primarily as a lock forward.

Hogan was born in Brisbane and played his junior football on Bribie
Island, and represented the Australian Schoolboys at under-15s level
and Queensland as an under-16.[1] He moved to Sydney to sign
professionally for the St George Dragons, before returning to
Queensland to join the North Queensland Cowboys in 2008, where he was
a member of the Under 20 team. He was named the youth team's player of
the season in 2009 and made his first-grade début for the Cowboys the
following season.[2]

Hogan made his NRL debut for the Cowboys in Round 9 of the 2010
season, he went on to play 10 matches that season. In hast last two
seasons with the club Hogan failed to make another appearance for the
North Queenslander's after an injury plagued season in 2011. In 2012
despite showing consistent form in the QCup Hogan failed to play a
single match for the Cowboys with Gavin Cooper, Glenn Hall, Dallas
Johnson, Jason Taumalolo, Joel Reithmuller and Cory Paterson all ahead
of him in the clubs pecking order for back-rowers.

In 2013 Hogan will play for Queensland Cup outfit Easts Tigers.

Viktor Petrov (Ukrainian: Віктор Петров 1894 – 1969) was a prominent
Soviet Ukrainian existentialist writer. He signed his works with pen
names Viktor Domontovych (Ukrainian: Віктор Домонтович) and Viktor Ber
(Ukrainian: Віктор Бер). Together with Valerian Pidmohylny Petrov is
considered to be the founder of the Ukrainian intellectual
novel. Although Petrov is remembered as a writer today, during his
life he was a scientist in the first place. He wrote papers on
archaeology, anthropology, history, philosophy and literature.

Viktor Petrov was born on 10 October 1894 in Yekaterinoslav (today's
Dnipropetrovsk). In 1918 he graduated from historical-philological
faculty of Kiev University. Later he worked at the ethnographic
committee of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. In 1930 he obtained
his doctorate for a study titled Panteleymon Kulish in the
50s. Life. Ideology. Creativity. During the World War II he was in
the territory occupied by Germans where he worked in several Ukrainian
magazines and newspapers.

After World War II Petrov stayed in emigration in Germany, during
which he was a professor at the Ukrainian Free University in
Munich. He was also one of the founding members of the Ukrainian
artist movement, a literary organization of the Ukrainian intellectual
diaspora. At a later time Petrov disappeared from Germany under
unknown circumstances. Later it was discovered (due to a reference to
him in A. Mongait's survey book) that he returned to the Soviet Union
and kept working at the Institute of Archaeology in Kiev. Petrov died
in 1969 and is buried in Kiev.

The M3 is an expressway in Cape Town, South Africa, connecting the
upper part of the City Bowl to the Southern Suburbs and ending in
Tokai. For most of its route it parallels - though further to the
south and west - the M4 (Main Road), which was the original road
connecting central Cape Town with the settlements to the south.

Route[edit] The M3 begins at a traffic light on Buitengracht Street
(the M62) and runs south-east as Buitensingel Street, a dual-carriage
roadway. For the next three kilometres it runs south and then east
through Gardens; it changes names regularly, being named Orange
Street, Annandale Road, Mill Street and Jutland Avenue. At Roeland
Street, which is numbered as Exit 1, the M3 becomes a grade separated
dual carriageway and takes on the name De Waal Drive. From there it
runs eastwards across the north face of Devil's Peak to Hospital Bend,
located immediately next to Groote Schuur Hospital, where it
intersects with the N2 Eastern Boulevard.

Around Hospital Bend the M3 is concurrent with the N2 for
approximately a kilometre; when the N2 branches off to the east as
Settlers Way, the M3 runs south as Rhodes Drive past the University of
Cape Town. This section of the highway forms the western boundary of
the suburbs of Mowbray, Rosebank, Rondebosch, and part of Newlands. It
separates these suburbs from the Table Mountain National Park, except
where the Upper Campus of the University is located west of the
freeway.

In Newlands, the M3 turns away from Table Mountain and the grade
separation ends; there are 5 traffic lights along this section. In
this area it is named variously Union Avenue, Paradise Road and
Edinburgh Drive. As it passes over Wynberg Hill, the M3 attains
freeway status. This section is known officially as the Simon van der
Stel Freeway and colloquially as the Blue Route. It proceeds southward
through Constantia and Tokai, terminating at exit 23, an intersection
with Steenberg Road (the M42). Steenberg Road connects the terminus of
the M3 with Main Road (the M4), which continues southwards along the
False Bay coast to Muizenberg, Fish Hoek, and Simon's Town; and with
Ou Kaapse Weg (the M64), which crosses the Silvermine mountains to
Noordhoek.

Original plans were for the M3 to continue southwards as a freeway, as
can be seen by the unfinished strips of tar under the bridge.

The M3 passes through the following suburbs:

Cape Town CBD Gardens Vredehoek Zonnebloem Woodstock Observatory
Mowbray Rosebank Rondebosch Newlands Claremont Bishopscourt Wynberg
Constantia Meadowridge Bergvliet Tokai Kirstenhof

These are the official results of the Women's 800 metres event at the
1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. The competition was held on 31 of
August & 3 of September. The favorite coming into the Olympics was
West German champion and world record holder Hildegard Falck. In the
1971 West German Championships she became the first woman to
officially better two minutes. She was the pre Olympic favorite to win
the gold, the rest of the field was wide open to claim the other
podium spots.[1]

John Adam Cramb (4 May 1862 – October 1913) was a Scottish historian
and fervent patriot. He published non-fiction works under his own
name, and fiction under the pseudonym of R. A. Revermont.

Cramb was born at Denny, Falkirk in Scotland, on the 4th of May,
1862. On leaving school he went to University of Glasgow, where he
graduated in 1885, taking 1st Class Honours in Classics. In the same
year he was appointed to the Luke Fellowship in English Literature, he
also studied at University of Bonn. He subsequently travelled in
continental Europe, and in 1887 he married the third daughter of the
late Mr. Edward W. Selby Lowndes of Winslow, and left one son. From
1888 to 1890 he was Lecturer in Modern History at Queen Margaret
College, Glasgow.

Settling in London in 1890 he contributed several articles to the
Dictionary of National Biography, and also occasional reviews to
periodicals. For many years he was an examiner for the Civil Service
Commission. In 1892 he was appointed Lecturer and in 1893 Professor of
Modern History at Queen's College, London, where he lectured until his
death. He was also an occasional lecturer on military history at the
Staff College, Camberley, and at York, Chatham, and other centres. In
London he gave private courses on history, literature and
philosophy. His last series of lectures was delivered in February and
March, 1913, the subject being the relations between England and
Germany. In response to many requests he was engaged in preparing
these lectures for publication when, in October 1913, he died.

History and mythology[edit] In the Babylonian star catalogues,
Triangulum, together with Gamma Andromedae, formed the constellation
known as MULAPIN (𒀯𒀳) The Plough. It is notable as the first
constellation presented on (and giving its name to) a pair of tablets
containing canonical star lists that were compiled around 1000 BC, the
MUL.APIN. The Plough was the first constellation of the Way of
Enlil—that is, the northernmost quarter of the Sun's path, which
corresponds to the 45 days on either side of summer solstice. Its
first appearance in the pre-dawn sky (heliacal rising) in February
marked the time to begin Spring ploughing in Mesopotamia.[2]

The Ancient Greeks called Triangulum Deltoton (Δελτωτόν), as the
constellation resembled an upper-case Greek letter delta (Δ). It was
transliterated by Roman writers, then later Latinised as Deltotum.[3]
Eratosthenes linked it with the Nile Delta, while the Roman writer
Hyginus associated it with the triangular island of Sicily, formerly
known as Trinacria due to its shape.[4] It was also called Sicilia,
because the Romans believed Ceres, patron goddess of Sicily, begged
Jupiter to place the island in the heavens.[3] Greek astronomers such
as Hipparchos and Ptolemy called it Trigonon (Τρίγωνον), and later, it
was Romanized as Trigonum. Other names referring to its shape include
Tricuspis and Triquetrum.[3] Alpha and Beta Trianguli were called Al
Mīzān, which is Arabic for The Scale Beam.[5] In Chinese astronomy,
Gamma Andromedae and neighbouring stars including Beta, Gamma and
Delta Trianguli were called Teen Ta Tseang Keun (天大将军, Heaven's
great general), representing honour in astrology and a great general
in mythology.[4][6]

Later, the 17th-century German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer
called the constellation Triplicitas and Orbis terrarum tripertitus,
for the three regions Europe, Asia, and Africa. Triangulus
Septentrionalis was a name used to distinguish it from Triangulum
Australe, the Southern Triangle.[3] Polish astronomer Johannes
Hevelius excised three faint stars— 6, 10 and 12 Trianguli—to form the
new constellation of Triangulum Minus in his 1690 Firmamentum
Sobiescianum, renaming the original as Triangulum Majus.[7] The
smaller constellation was not recognised by the International
Astronomical Union (IAU) when the constellations were established in
the 1920s.[5]

Characteristics[edit] A small constellation, Triangulum is bordered by
Andromeda to the north and west, Pisces to the west and south, Aries
to the south, and Perseus to the east. The centre of the constellation
lies half way between Gamma Andromedae and Alpha Arietis.[8] The
three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU
in 1922, is 'Tri'.[9] The official constellation boundaries, as set by
Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 14 segments. In
the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of
these borders lie between 01h 31.3m and 02h 50.4m, while the
declination coordinates are between 25.60° and 37.35°.[1] Covering 132
square degrees and 0.320% of the night sky, Triangulum ranks 78th of
the 88 constellations in size.[10]

Notable features[edit] See also: List of stars in Triangulum Bayer
catalogued five stars in the constellation, giving them the Bayer
designations Alpha to Epsilon. John Flamsteed added Eta, Iota and four
Roman letters; of these, only Iota is still used as the others were
dropped in subsequent catalogues and star charts.[11] Flamsteed gave
16 stars Flamsteed designations, of which numbers 1 and 16 are not
used—1's coordinates were in error as there was no star present at the
location that corresponds to any star in his Catalogus Britannicus;
Baily presumed that the coordinates were mistranscribed 32s in error
by Flamsteed and in fact referred to 7.4 magnitude HD 10407. Baily
also noted that 16 Trianguli was closer to Aries and included it in
the latter constellation.[11]



The constellation Triangulum as it can be seen by the naked eye.
Stars[edit] Three stars make up the long narrow triangle that gives
the constellation its name. The brightest member is the white giant
star Beta Trianguli of apparent magnitude 3.00,[5] lying 127
light-years distant from Earth.[12] It is actually a spectroscopic
binary system; the primary is a white star of spectral type A5IV with
3.5 times the mass of our sun that is beginning to expand and evolve
off the main sequence. The secondary is poorly known, but calculated
to be a yellow-white F-type main-sequence star around 1.4 solar
masses. The two orbit around a common centre of gravity every 31 days,
and are surrounded by a ring of dust that extends from 50 to 400 AU
away from the stars.[13]

The second-brightest star, the yellow-white subgiant star Alpha
Trianguli (3.41m) with a close dimmer companion, is also known as
Caput Trianguli or Ras al Muthallath, and is at the apex of the
triangle. It lies around 7 degrees north-northwest of Alpha
Arietis.[14] Making up the triangle is Gamma Trianguli, a white main
sequence star of spectral type A1Vnn of apparent magnitude 4.00 about
112 light-years from Earth.[15] It is around double the size of and
around 33 times as luminous as the sun and rotates rapidly. Like Beta,
it is surrounded by a dusty debris disk, which has a radius 80 times
the distance of the Earth from the Sun.[16] Lying near Gamma and
forming an optical triple system with it are Delta and 7
Trianguli. Delta is a spectroscopic binary system composed of two
yellow main sequence stars of similar dimensions to the Sun that lies
35 light-years from Earth. The two stars orbit each other every ten
days and are a mere 0.1 AU apart.[17] This system is the closest in
the constellation to the Earth.[10] Only of magnitude 5.25, 7
Trianguli is much further away at around 280 light-years distant from
Earth.[18]

Iota Trianguli is a double star whose components can be separated by
medium-sized telescopes into a strong yellow and a contrasting pale
blue star. Both of these are themselves close binaries.[19] X
Trianguli is an eclipsing binary system that ranges between magnitudes
8.5 and 11.2 over a period of 0.97 days.[20] RW Trianguli is a
cataclysmic variable star system composed of a white dwarf primary and
an orange main sequence star of spectral type K7 V. The former is
drawing off matter from the latter, forming a prominent accretion
disc. The system is around 1075 light-years distant.[21]

R Trianguli is a long period (Mira) variable that ranges from
magnitude 6.2 to 11.7 over a period of 267 days.[20] It is a red giant
of spectral type M3.5-8e, lying around 960 light-years away.[22] HD
12545, also known as XX Trianguli, is an orange giant of spectral type
K0III around 520 light-years distant with a visual magnitude of
8.42.[23] A huge starspot larger than the diameter of the sun was
detected on its surface in 1999 by astronomers using Doppler
imaging.[24]

Three star systems appear to have planets. HD 9446 is a sun-like star
around 171 light-years distant that has two planets of masses 0.7 and
1.8 times that of Jupiter, with orbital periods of 30 and 193 days
respectively.[25] WASP-56 is a sun-like star of spectral type G6 and
apparent magnitude 11.48 with a planet 0.6 the mass of Jupiter that
has a period of 4.6 days.[26] HD 13189 is an orange giant of spectral
type K2II about 2–7 times as massive as the sun with a planetary or
brown dwarf companion between 8 and 20 times as massive as Jupiter,
which takes 472 days to complete an orbit. It is one of the largest
stars discovered to have a planetary companion.[27]

Deep-sky objects[edit] The Triangulum Galaxy, also known as Messier
33, was discovered by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 1600s. A
distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years
away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough to be seen by the naked
eye under the darkest skies. Under light-polluted skies, it is
challenging or invisible even in a small telescope or
binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is
required. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years
and is thus smaller than both the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky
Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda
supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger
galaxy.[28] Within the constellation, it lies near the border of
Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees
southwest of Beta Andromedae.[14] Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H
II region where star formation takes place.[29]

In addition to M33, there are several NGC galaxies of visual
magnitudes 12 to 14.[5] The largest of these include the 10 arcminute
long magnitude 12 NGC 925 spiral galaxy and the 5 arcminute long
magnitude 11.6 NGC 672 barred spiral galaxy. The latter is close by
and appears to be interacting with IC 1727. The two are 88,000
light-years apart and lie around 18 million light-years away.[30]
These two plus another four nearby dwarf irregular galaxies constitute
the NGC 672 group, and all six appear to have had a burst of star
formation in the last ten million years. The group is thought
connected to another group of six galaxies known as the NGC 784 group,
named for its principal galaxy, the barred spiral NGC 784. Together
with two isolated dwarf galaxies, these fourteen appear to be moving
in a common direction and constitute a group possibly located on a
dark matter filament.[31] 3C 48 was the first quasar ever to be
observed, although its true identity was not uncovered until after
that of 3C 273 in 1963.[32] It has an apparent magnitude of 16.2 and
is located about 5 degrees northwest of Alpha Trianguli.[14]

Triangulum is a small constellation in the northern sky. Its name is
Latin for triangle, derived from its three brightest stars, which
form a long and narrow triangle. Known to the ancient Babylonians and
Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd
century astronomer Ptolemy. The celestial cartographers Johann Bayer
and John Flamsteed catalogued the constellation's stars, giving six of
them Bayer designations.

The white stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli, of apparent magnitudes 3.00
and 4.00, respectively, form the base of the triangle and the
yellow-white Alpha Trianguli, of magnitude 3.41, the apex. Iota
Trianguli is a notable double star system, and there are three star
systems with planets located in Triangulum. The constellation contains
several galaxies, the brightest and nearest of which is the Triangulum
Galaxy—a member of the Local Group. The first quasar ever observed, 3C
48, lies within Triangulum's boundaries.

Heartbleed is a software bug in the open-source cryptography library
OpenSSL, which allows an attacker to read the memory of the host
computer, allowing them to retrieve potentially privacy-sensitive
data.[3][4][5][6]

Based on examinations of audit logs by researchers, it has been
reported that some attackers may have exploited the flaw for at least
five months before discovery and announcement.[7][8][9] There have
been unconfirmed reports that the United States National Security
Agency was aware of the flaw since shortly after its introduction, but
chose to keep it secret, instead of reporting it, in order to exploit
it for their own purposes.[10]

History[edit] In April 2014, Neel Mehta of Google Security reported a
bug in all versions of OpenSSL in the 1.0.1 series released since
March 14, 2012. The bug entailed a severe memory handling error in the
implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Heartbeat
Extension.[11][12] This defect could be used to reveal up to 64
kilobytes of the application's memory with every heartbeat.[13] The
bug is registered in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system
as CVE-2014-0160.[14]

The bug is exercised by sending a malformed heartbeat request to the
server in order to elicit the server's response, which normally
consists of the same data buffer that was received. Due to a lack of
bounds checking, the affected versions of OpenSSL did not verify the
validity of the heartbeat request size, permitting attackers to read
an arbitrary size of server memory.[15]

The vulnerability has existed since December 31, 2011 and the
vulnerable code has been in widespread use since the release of
OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012.[16][17][18]

The bug was named by an engineer at the firm Codenomicon, a Finnish
cybersecurity company, which also created the bleeding heart logo, and
launched the domain Heartbleed.com to explain the bug to the
public.[19] According to Codenomicon, Neel Mehta of Google Security
first reported the bug to OpenSSL, but both Google and Codenomicon
discovered it independently.[16] Mehta also congratulated Codenomicon,
without going into detail about their role.[20]

Impact[edit] By reading an arbitrary block of the web server's memory,
attackers might receive sensitive data, compromising the security of
the server and its users. Vulnerable data include the server's private
master key,[16][18] which would enable attackers to decrypt current or
stored traffic via passive man-in-the-middle attack (if perfect
forward secrecy is not used by the server and client), or active
man-in-the-middle if perfect forward secrecy is used. The attacker
cannot control which data are returned, as the server responds with a
random chunk of its own memory.

The bug might also reveal unencrypted parts of users' requests and
responses, including any form post data in users' requests, session
cookies and passwords, which might allow attackers to hijack the
identity of another user of the service.[21] At its disclosure, some
17% or half a million of the Internet's secure web servers certified
by trusted authorities were believed to have been vulnerable to an
attack.[22] The Electronic Frontier Foundation,[23] Ars Technica,[24]
and Bruce Schneier[25] all deemed the Heartbleed bug catastrophic.
Forbes cybersecurity columnist, Joseph Steinberg, described the bug as
potentially the worst vulnerability found (at least in terms of its
potential impact) since commercial traffic began to flow on the
Internet.[26]

Affected OpenSSL versions[edit] OpenSSL 1.0.2-beta OpenSSL 1.0.1 –
OpenSSL 1.0.1f Unless an operating system patch for CVE-2014-0160 has
been installed that doesn't change the library version, which is the
case for Debian (including derivatives such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint),
FreeBSD and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including derivatives such as
CentOS and Amazon Linux.  Unaffected versions[edit] OpenSSL
1.0.2-beta2 (upcoming) OpenSSL 1.0.1g OpenSSL 1.0.0 (and 1.0.0 branch
releases) OpenSSL 0.9.8 (and 0.9.8 branch releases) To resolve the
bug, server administrators are advised[by whom?] to either use 1.0.1g
or to recompile OpenSSL with -DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS, thus disabling
the vulnerable feature until the server software can be updated.

Reaction[edit] On the day of the announcement, 7 April 2014, the Tor
Project issued an announcement on its blog and advised that anyone
seeking strong anonymity or privacy on the Internet should stay
away from the Internet entirely for the next few days while things
settle. They also recommended that Tor relay operators and hidden
service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching
OpenSSL, but noted that Tor relays use two sets of keys and that Tor's
multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single
relay.[27]

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) closed down its electronic services
website over Heartbleed bug security concerns.[28]

Platform maintainers like the Wikimedia Foundation advised their users
to change passwords.[29]

An analysis posted on GitHub of the top 1000 most visited websites as
of April 8, 2014 revealed vulnerabilities in sites including Yahoo!,
Imgur, Stack Overflow, Slate, and DuckDuckGo.[30][31]

Theo de Raadt, founder and leader of the OpenBSD and OpenSSH projects,
has criticized the OpenSSL developers for explicitly circumventing
OpenBSD C standard library exploit countermeasures, saying OpenSSL is
not developed by a responsible team.[32][33]

The author of the bug, Robin Seggelmann,[34] stated that he missed
validating a variable containing a length and denied any intention to
submit a flawed implementation.[35]

Affected websites and services[edit] Announcements[edit] The following
sites have services affected or made announcements recommending that
users update passwords in response to the bug:

Akamai Technologies[36] Amazon Web Services[37] Ars Technica[38]
Bitbucket[39] BrandVerity[40] GitHub[41] IFTTT[42] PeerJ[43]
SoundCloud[44] SourceForge[45] SparkFun[46] Stripe (company)[47]
Tumblr[48][49] Wattpad Wikimedia (including Wikipedia)[29][50]
Wunderlist[51] LastPass Password Manager was not vulnerable, due its
use of forward secrecy, but it recommended users change passwords that
LastPass stored for vulnerable websites.[52]

LogMeIn claimed to have updated many products and parts of our
services that rely on OpenSSL.[53]

Affected software applications[edit] IPCop 2.1.4 was released on April
8, 2014 with a fix for the OpenSSL library everybody is talking
about.[54] LibreOffice 4.2.3 was released on April 10, 2014 with a
fix for CVE-2014-0160[55] LogMeIn claimed to have updated many
products and parts of our services that rely on OpenSSL.[53] National
Security Agency exploitation[edit] Bloomberg News reported that the
United States' National Security Agency regularly exploited the bug to
gather intelligence, and has been aware of the bug for at least two
years. [10][56][57]

Fix[edit] The bug is classified as a buffer over-read,[58] a situation
where software allows more data to be read than should be allowed.[59]

Version 1.0.1g of OpenSSL adds some bounds checks to prevent the
buffer over-read. For example, the test

if (1 + 2 + payload + 16 > s->s3->rrec.length) return 0; /* silently
discard per RFC 6520 sec. 4 */ has been added in front of the line

pl = p; A complete list of changes is available at
git.openssl.org.[60]

Although patching software (the OpenSSL library and any statically
linked binaries) fixes the bug, running software will continue to use
its in-memory OpenSSL code with the bug until each application is shut
down and restarted, so that the patched code can be loaded. Further,
in order to regain privacy and secrecy, all private or secret data
must be replaced, since it is not possible to know if they were
compromised while the vulnerable code was in use:[61]

all possibly compromised private key-public key pairs must be
regenerated, all certificates linked to those possibly compromised key
pairs need to be revoked and replaced, and all passwords on the
possibly compromised servers need to be changed.  Testing for
vulnerabilities[edit] Several services were made available to test
whether the Heartbleed bug was present on a given site, including:

Heartbleed testing tool by a European IT security company[62]
Heartbleed Scanner by Italian cryptologist Filippo Valsorda[63]
Metasploit Heartbleed scanner module[64] Heartbleed Server Scanner by
Rehmann[65] Lookout Mobile Security Heartbleed Detector, an app for
Android devices that determines the OpenSSL version of the device and
indicates whether the vulnerable heartbeat is enabled[66] Heartbleed
checker hosted by LastPass[67] Network range scanner for Heartbleed
vulnerability by a security testing company [68] Official offline

SSL Labs' SSL Server Test which not only looks for the Heartbleed bug,
but can also find other insecure SSL/TLS implementation errors like
supporting the totally broken SSL2, insecure renegotiation, and weak
ciphers.  Other security tools have added support for finding this
bug. For example, Sourcefire has released Snort rules to detect
Heartbleed attack traffic and possible Heartbleed response
traffic.[69] Tenable Network Security wrote a plugin for its Nessus
vulnerability scanner that can scan for this fault.[70]

The Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych (or Diptych with Calvary
and Last Judgement)[1] consists of two small painted panels attributed
to the Early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck, with areas finished by
unidentified followers or members of his workshop. This diptych is one
of the early Northern Renaissance oil on panel masterpieces, renowned
for its unusually complex and highly detailed iconography, and for the
technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a
miniature format; the panels are just 56.5 cm (22.2 in) high by 19.7
cm (7.8 in) wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for personal
and private devotion.

The left-hand wing depicts the Crucifixion. It shows Christ's
followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling
about in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in
the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky with a view
of Jerusalem in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes
associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the
resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a
representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of
saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper
section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew
inscriptions.[2] The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in
Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and
Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse,
the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.

The earliest surviving mention of the work appears in 1841, when
scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost triptych.[3] The
Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time,
the work was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert[4] because key areas
formally resembled pages of the Turin-Milan Hours, which were then
believed to be of Hubert's hand.[5] On the evidence of technique and
the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe
the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s
and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck
painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker
passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.[5][6]

Format and technique[edit] Along with Robert Campin and later Rogier
van der Weyden, Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards
naturalism and realism in Northern European painting during the early
to mid 15th century.[7] He was the first to manipulate oils to give
the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of
realism and complexity of emotion seen in this diptych.[8] He coupled
this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep
perspective—most noticeable in the upper portion of the Crucifixion
panel—which had not been achieved before.[9]

In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in
their infancy, vertical formats were often used for depictions of the
Last Judgement, because the narrow framing particularly suited a
hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast,
depictions of the Crucifixion were usually presented in a horizontal
format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto
two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a
number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the Crucifixion
panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the
Judgement narrative.[3][6] The result is a panel with the crosses
rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the
mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the
foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in
the style of medieval tapestries. Art historian Otto Pächt says it is
the whole world in one painting, an Orbis Pictus.[10]

In the Crucifixion panel, van Eyck follows the early 14th-century
tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative
technique.[11] According to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, the
episodes appear as simultaneous, not sequential events.[3] Van Eyck
condenses key episodes from the gospels into a single composition,
each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a logical
sequence.[11] This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater
illusion of depth with more complex and unusual spatial
arrangements.[3] In the Crucifixion panel, he uses different
indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of
figures to Jesus. Given the size of the mourners in the foreground
relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators
gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to
perspective would allow. In the Last Judgement the damned are placed
in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are
positioned higher in the upper foreground.[6] Pächt writes of this
panel that the scene is assimilated into a single spacial cosmos,
with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between
heaven and hell.[10]

Art historians are unsure as to whether the panels were meant to be a
diptych or a triptych.[12] They may have formed the outer wings of a
triptych, with a since-lost panel representing the Adoration of the
Magi at the centre,[13] or, as the German art historian J.D. Passavant
speculated in 1841, the lost centre panel may have been a Nativity.[2]
It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated
original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been
very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed
that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Châtelet writes,
the central panel may have been stolen.[13][14] Art historian Erwin
Panofsky believed the Crucifixion and Last Judgement panels were
intended as a diptych. He argued that it would have been unusual for
mere outer wings to have been given the sumptuous treatment afforded
these two panels.[15] This approach is reminiscent of the medieval
reliquaries.[5] Others have observed that triptychs were usually much
larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards
gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel
would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary
diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and
were typically ungilded.[2] There is no documentary evidence for an
original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests
the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging
format.[16] Pächt believes there is not enough evidence to determine
whether a third panel existed.[12]

The diptych[edit] Crucifixion panel[edit] The Crucifixion panel
comprises three horizontal planes, each representing different moments
from the Passion. The upper third shows the crucifixion before a view
of Jerusalem; the lower two thirds detail the crowds and Jesus'
followers at Golgotha (Place of the Skull).[17] Located outside the
city walls amongst rock tombs and gardens, in the first century
Golgotha was Jerusalem's place of execution,[18] and the visible
patches of hill highlight the area's stony, forbidding, and lifeless
nature.[19] The atmosphere of bleakness is reinforced by the random
figures in the upper ground that scramble for a better view.[17] The
gospels tell of Jesus' followers and relatives, as well as his
prosecutors and assorted spectators, attending the crucifixion at
Golgotha. In van Eyck's panel the former are represented in the
foreground, while the latter, including High Priests and Temple
Elders, are shown in the mid-ground.[19]



Death of Christ on the cross. Typically, a crucifixion victim's legs
were broken to hasten death. According to the Gospel of John, when
soldiers came to break Jesus' legs, they found him already dead. A
soldier pierced his side with a lance; blood and water poured from the
wound.[20] The centre foreground shows a group of five mourners, with
three other figures set to the right and left. In the center group,
John the Evangelist supports the Virgin Mary, surrounded by three
women. Mary's dramatic swoon in grief pushes her forward in the
pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her closest to the
viewer's presumed position.[21] Dressed in an enveloping blue robe
that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who
supports her by her arms. Mary Magdalene kneels to the right, dressed
in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft,
she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner.[3][22] She
is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ
and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's
gaze upwards towards the crosses.[23] The fourth and fifth mourners
have been identified as prophesying sibyls, and stand to the far left
and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross
with her back to the viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right
faces the group and is either the Erythraean or the Cumaean sibyl,[23]
both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the
occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around
Christ's death and resurrection.[6] She has an almost indifferent
expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing
her prophesies realised,[19] and as compassionate contemplation of the
other women's grief.[24]

The mid-ground shows a crowd scene above the group of mourners,
separated by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The
mourners from the foreground are reflected in the shield carried on
the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who leans on the man to his
right wearing a red turban. Smith believes this serves to highlight
the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted
figures gathered in the mid-ground.[21] Art historian Adam Labuda sees
these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners
and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the
Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the
panel's dramatic sequence.[25]



The taunting of the condemned. At the time there were many enemies of
the Temple and Jesus was seen by the Jewish hierarchy merely as the
charismatic successor to John the Baptist. Although he became enough
of a legitimate threat to be executed, he was ultimately viewed by the
elders as just another agitating pseudo-prophet.[26] According to
Burroughs, van Eyck's depiction lays particular emphasis on the
brutishness and indifference of the crowd witnessing Christ's
suffering.[27] They comprise a mixture of Roman legionaries, judges
and various hangers-on arriving to witness the spectacle.[19] A number
are dressed in rich, brightly coloured clothes, a mixture of oriental
and northern European styles,[9] while several are mounted on
horseback. Some openly jeer and taunt the condemned, others gape
stupefied at just another execution,[27] while others talk amongst
themselves. The exception is the armoured centurion, seated on a white
horse at the extreme right edge of the panel, who looks up at Christ,
arms spread wide, head thrown back, at the very moment of his
illumination in recognition of Christ's divinity.[19] The horsemen
closely resemble both the Soldiers of Christ and Righteous Judges from
the lower inner panels of van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece. Art
historian Till-Holger Borchert observes that these figures are given
greater dynamism by being seen in rear rather than profile view, and
that this vantage point draws the observer's eye upwards towards the
mid-ground and the crucifixion.[6]

Van Eyck extends the height of the crosses to an unrealistic degree to
allow the crucifixion to dominate the upper third of the panel. Christ
faces the viewer directly, while the crosses of the two thieves are
set at angles to either side.[9] The thieves are each bound with cords
of rope rather than nails.[24] The body of the thief to the right—the
repentant thief mentioned in the Gospel of Luke—is lifeless. The bad
thief to his left is dying twisted in pain, and according to art
historian James W.H. Weale, depicted as struggling desperately, but
in vain.[28] Both men's hands have turned black from a lack of blood
flow.[3] A placard prepared by Pilate or Roman soldiers placed above
Jesus' head reads Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews in Hebrew,
Latin and Greek.[19]



Leaf from the Turin-Milan Hours, unknown artist, c. 1440–1450. This
illustration is often attributed to Jan van Eyck or a member of his
workshop.  The panel captures the instant of Christ's death,[24]
traditionally the moment after the breaking of the thieves' legs
(although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a
transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible.[9] His hands
and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his
feet to the cross stains its wooden base.[3] His arms strain under the
weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen
slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of
death.[27] In the mid-ground, at the base of the cross, Longinus, on
horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an
assistant,[24][29] stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance,[19]
as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a
mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on
the tip of a reed.[19]

The first generation of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually
pay much attention to landscape backgrounds. They were often included,
showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as
minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and
lacking any real observation of nature.[30] This diptych, however,
contains one of the most memorable landscape backgrounds in Northern
15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in
the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The
sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is
rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are
similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are
included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape.[31] The
sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the
panel captures the moment of Jesus' death.[19] Faint cirrus clouds can
be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is
suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.[3]

Last Judgement panel[edit]


Saint Michael the Archangel bestrides the damned, while behind him the
resurrected emerge from their graves before a burning city.[13] The
right hand wing, as with the Crucifixion wing, is divided horizontally
into three areas. Here they represent, from top to bottom heaven,
earth and hell. Heaven contains a traditional Great Deësis with clergy
and laity; earth, in the mid-ground, is dominated by the figures of
Archangel Michael and a personification of Death; while in the lower
ground the damned fall into hell and are tortured and eaten by
beasts.[32] Describing the hell passage, art historian Bryson
Burroughs writes that the diabolical inventions of Bosch and Brueghel
are children's boggy lands compared to the horrors of the hell [van
Eyck] has imagined.[33][34] Pächt compares the scene to a medieval
bestiary, comprising a whole fauna of zoomorphic fiends. Van Eyck's
hell is inhabited by demonic monsters whose only visible features are
often their glittering eyes and the white of their fangs.[10] The
sinners fall head first into their torment, at the mercy of devils
taking recognisable forms such as rats, snakes and pigs, as well as a
bear and a donkey.[27] Daringly, van Eyck shows kings and members of
the clergy among those condemned to hell.[21]

The earth is represented by the narrow area between heaven and
hell. The passage shows the resurrection of the dead as the fires of
the last day rage. The dead rise from their graves to the left and
from the stormy sea to the right.[27] The Archangel Michael stands on
death's shoulders,[6] the largest figure in the painting, whose body
and wings span the entire pictorial space.[10] Michael wears
jewel-studded golden armour and has curly blond hair and multicoloured
wings similar to those seen in the donor panel of van Eyck's 1437
Dresden Triptych of the Virgin and Child.[6] Michael appears,
according to Smith, like a giant on the earth, whose crust is
revealed to be the wings of the skeletal figure of Death. The damned
are excreted though Death's bowels into the dark slime of hell.[21]
The bat-like death figure, with skull extruding up to earth and
skeletal arms and legs reaching down into hell, is the protagonist of
the narrative according to Pächt, but death is vanquished by the slim
and youthful looking archangel standing between the horrors of hell
and the promise of heaven.[10]



A personification of death spreads its skeletal wings over the fallen
and damned, a number of whom can be identified by their headdress as
members of the clergy.  The upper portion of the panel shows the
second coming as recorded in Matthew 25:31: But when the Son of Man
comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit
on the throne of his glory.[35] Christ, who was naked, frail and
almost lifeless in the Crucifixion panel, is now resurrected and
triumphant in heaven.[21] He is dressed in a long red mantle and is
barefoot. His hands and feet are surrounded by circles of yellow
light.[28] The Holy Wounds are visible on his palms held open; the
puncture mark left by Longinus' spear is visible on his side through
the opening in his robe, as are the nail holes on his feet.[36]

Christ is seated at the centre of a large array of angels, saints and
holy elders.[36] According to Pächt, in this scene in heaven that all
is sweetness, gentleness and order.[37] Mary and John the Baptist
kneel in prayer to his immediate right and left. Both have halos and
are rendered at a far larger scale than the surrounding figures, over
whom they seem to tower. Mary holds her right hand at her breast,
while her left is raised as if to ask for mercy for the smaller naked
figures sheltered by her cloak, evoking the conventional pose of the
Virgin of Mercy. A choir of virgins gather directly under Christ's
feet. They face outwards towards the viewer and sing Christ's
praise.[36]



Detail of the Christ in Majesty. This area is considered to have been
painted more broadly and with less skill than the other sections of
the panels, and is thus thought by some to have been painted by
members of van Eyck's workshop.[38] Headed by Saint Peter, the
Apostles are dressed in white robes and sit on two facing benches set
below Christ and to the right and left of the choir of virgins. Two
angels attend to the groups gathered at each side of the benches.[39]
A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They
hold his cross and are dressed in white amice and albs, with the right
hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked
on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably
trumpets.[28] The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols
of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The
angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the
right a sponge and nails.[34][36]

Van Eyck was a central influence on Petrus Christus and the younger
painter is thought to have studied the panels while they were still in
van Eyck's workshop.[6] He made a much larger and adapted paraphrase
of the panel in 1452, as part of a monumental altarpiece, now in
Berlin.[40] Although there are significant differences between the two
works, the influence of van Eyck on Christus' work is most evident in
the vertical, narrow format and in the central figure of Saint
Michael, who also divides the scene between heaven and hell.[41]

Iconography[edit] Art historian John Ward highlights the rich and
complex iconography and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed to bring
attention to what he saw as the co-existence of the spiritual and
material worlds. In his paintings, iconographical features are
typically subtly woven into the work, as relatively small, in the
background, or in the shadow [details].[42] The significance of the
imagery is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to
be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meanings become
apparent. According to Ward, the iconographical elements are commonly
positioned initially to overlook, and eventually to discover.[43]
Writing about the Last Judgement panel, Burroughs notes that each of
its several scenes requires attention for itself alone.[27] According
to Ward, van Eyck forces the viewer to search for the meaning in the
iconography, creating a multi-layered surface which rewards the
attentive viewer with deeper understanding of both the painting and
its symbols.[44] Much of van Eyck's iconography intends to convey the
idea of the promised passage from sin and death to salvation and
rebirth.[45]

Inscriptions[edit] Both the frames and pictorial areas of the diptych
are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and
Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for
inscriptions,[46][47] which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative
while also functioning in a manner similar to the commentaries often
seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the
significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually
commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected
the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.[21]

In this work, the inscriptions are in Roman capitals or Gothic
miniature,[47] and in some places seem to contain misspellings, making
interpretation difficult.[48] Its gold-lined frame and Latin
inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the
two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated.[5] The
sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the Book of
Isaiah (53:6–9, 12), Revelations (20:13, 21:3–4) or the Book of
Deuteronomy (32:23–24).[2] In the right hand panel, the wings of the
figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left
are the words CHAOS MAGNVM (great chaos), with UMBRA MORTIS (shadow
of death) inscribed to the right.[13] A warning from Matthew 25:41 is
written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from
earth down into the hell section. It reads, Ite vos maledicti in ignem
eternam (Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire). In this way, van
Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams
of light seemingly hurled from the heavens.[13] Also in the section
are letters reading ME OBVLIVI.[47]

In the mid-ground, the Archangel Michael's armour is heavily inscribed
with esoteric and often difficult to source phrases.[13] Letters on
his breast plate read VINAE(X)[47] while his jewel-encrusted oval
buckler displays the cross and is decorated with Greek script reading
ADORAVI TETGRAMMATHON AGLA.[13] The meaning of this phrase has not
been conclusively identified; some art historians believe it contains
misspellings and has been misread.[48] Friedländer transcribed the
first word as ADORAVI while the final word AGLA is thought be taken
from the first four letters of the Hebrew words for Thou Art Mighty,
and thus may signify God; the word also appears in a floor tile in the
Ghent Altarpiece.[2][31] In the upper portion, gilded inscriptions
running vertically across the edges of Christ's mantle read VENITE
BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI (Come, ye blessed of my father).[28]

Attribution and dating[edit] Over the years the panels have been
attributed to both Jan and Hubert van Eyck as well as Petrus
Christus. In 1841, Passavant attributed the diptych jointly to Hubert
and Jan van Eyck;[2] by 1853, he had revised his opinion and gave
attribution exclusively to Jan.[49] Gustav Waagen, the first director
of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, attributed them to Petrus Christus in
the mid 19th-century, based on the left hand panel's similarity in
composition to a 1452 Last Judgement signed by Christus now in
Berlin. This view was rejected in 1887, and they once more became
associated with Jan. The panels came into the possession of the
Hermitage Gallery in 1917, credited to Jan.[13]

Bryson Burroughs, writing for the Metropolitan at the time of their
acquisition in 1933, attributed the works to Hubert. Burroughs saw in
the panels the hand of an expressive artist, all nerves and
sensibilities,[30] overcome with sympathy for the plight of the
central figures in the panels, but who was nonetheless weak in drawing
line. This profile, he believed, was incompatible with the aloof and
impassive master craftsman Jan is known to have been.[30] Yet
Burroughs acknowledged there was no certain documented proof for the
attribution [to Hubert]. He admitted his evidence was limited,
inevitably incomplete, and thus circumstantial and presumptive.[50]
More recent scholarship tends to agree Jan painted the panels based on
the evidence that they are stylistically closer to Jan than Hubert,
who died in 1426; and that Jan, who travelled across the Alps to Italy
that year, painted the mountain range.[2]



Petrus Christus's Last Judgement (1452) is a much larger, though more
sparse and more easily read, near-copy of van Eyck's panel. Panofsky
commented that what [Christus] thought difficult to understand, he
explained; and what he chose to retain, he rendered in simple,
vernacular language.[51] Gemäldegalerie, Berlin The paintings have
often been compared to the seven pages of the Turin-Milan Hours
illuminated manuscript attributed to the unidentified artist Hand G,
generally thought to have been Jan van Eyck.[52] The closeness is seen
to lie both in the miniaturist technique and the particular painterly
style. The similarity of a Turin drawing of the crucified Christ to
the figure in the New York diptych has led some art historians to
conclude they were, at least, painted near the same time, during the
1420s and early 1430s. Most believe both the drawing and diptych panel
at least originated from a prototype designed by Jan van Eyck.[5]
Panofsky attributed the New York panels to Hand G.[53] When the
Turin-Milan Hours miniatures were discovered they were at first
believed to have been painted before the Duke of Berry's death in
1416, an idea that was quickly rejected with the date extended to
sometime in the early 1430s.[54]

Pächt writes of the diptych that it reflects the personal style and
unique scenic imagination of Hand G (whom he believed to be either
Hubert or Jan).[54] Until Hans Belting and Dagmar Eichberger's 1983
Jan van Eyck als Erzähler, academics tended to focus exclusively on
the diptych's dating and attribution, with little attention paid to
its source influences and iconography.[17] Borchert estimates a
completion of c. 1440, while Paul Durrieu suggests a dating as early
as 1413.[2] In 1983, Belting and Eichberger suggested a date of
c. 1430 based on specific characteristics of the work: the birds-eye
view perspective and horizon, the densely packed figures and,
especially, a pictorial narrative that moves logically across the
areas of the image in the Crucifixion panel.[23] Belting and
Eichberger believe this style was employed during the early panel
works, but was largely abandoned by the 1430s.[1]

The 1430s dating is supported by the style of the underdrawing, which
is consistent with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In
addition, the figures are dressed in clothes fashionable in the 1420s
with the exception of one of the possible donors, tentatively
identified as Margaret of Bavaria, who is depicted as the sybil
standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears
clothes in style in the early 1430s.[2]

The upper portions of the Last Judgement panel are generally
considered as the work of a weaker painter with a less individual
style. It is thought that van Eyck left the panels unfinished with
completed underdrawings, and the area was finished by workshop members
or by followers after he died.[5] Maryan Ainsworth of the Metropolitan
takes a different view. She highlights the close relationship known to
have existed between contemporary workshops in the Low Countries and
France, and speculates that a French miniaturist or illuminator,
perhaps from the workshop of the Bedford Master, travelled to Bruges
to assist van Eyck on the right hand panel.[53]

Provenance[edit] Nothing is known of the work's provenance before the
1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early
diptychs[27]—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for
private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated
patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier
centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions
and the abundant detail found across all areas of the panels.[5]

Writing in 1841 in the journal Kunstblatt,[55] Passavant gave an
account of how the panels were bought at auction from either a Spanish
monastery or convent. The Russian diplomat Dmitry Tatishchev acquired
the panels, possibly from a Spanish convent or monastery near Madrid
or Burgos, while living in Spain between 1814 and 1821.[2] Tatishchev
left his pictures to Tsar Nicholas I in 1845, and they came into the
possession of the Hermitage Gallery in Saint Petersburg in 1917.[56]

The panels were included in the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings,
which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436
Annunciation. They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art
dealer M. Knoedler & Company[57] for $185,000, significantly less than
the asking price of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931.[58]
The panels were shipped from Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen
Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler & Company sold them on to the
Metropolitan in New York that year.[50]

Lindow Man, also known as Lindow II and (in jest) as Pete Marsh, is
the preserved bog body of a man discovered in a peat bog at Lindow
Moss near Wilmslow in Cheshire, North West England. The body was found
on 1 August 1984 by commercial peat-cutters. Lindow Man is not the
only bog body to have been found in the moss; Lindow Woman was
discovered the year before, and other body parts have also been
recovered. The find, described as one of the most significant
archaeological discoveries of the 1980s,[1] caused a media
sensation. It helped invigorate study of British bog bodies, which had
previously been neglected in comparison to those found in the rest of
Europe.

At the time of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s,
and he may have been someone of high status, as his body shows little
evidence of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason
for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent,
perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man
was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body
has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was
deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BCE and 119
CE, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been
preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British
Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as
Manchester Museum.

Background[edit] Lindow Moss[edit] Main article: Lindow Common Lindow
Moss is a peat bog in Lindow, an area of Wilmslow, Cheshire, which has
been used as common land since the medieval period. It formed after
the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in north-east Cheshire
and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice.[2]
Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural
activity around the edge of Lindow Moss that would have been
contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat
suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity.[3] Once covering
over 600 hectares (1,500 acres), the bog has now shrunk to a tenth of
its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer
recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog
was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by
which time the process had been mechanised.[4] Lindow Moss is a
lowland raised mire; this type of peat bog often produces the best
preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised
mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the
Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27 bodies to be recovered from such
areas.[5]

Lindow Woman[edit] Main article: Lindow Woman On 13 May 1983, two peat
workers at Lindow Moss, Andy Mould and Stephen Dooley, noticed an
unusual object—about the size of a football—on the elevator taking
peat to the shredding machine. They removed the object for closer
inspection, joking that it was a dinosaur egg. Once the peat had been
removed, their discovery turned out to be a decomposing, incomplete
human head with one eye and some hair intact.[6] Forensics identified
the skull as belonging to a European woman, probably aged 30–50.[7][8]
Police initially thought the skull was that of Malika Reyn-Bardt, who
had disappeared in 1960 and was the subject of an ongoing
investigation.[9] While in prison on another charge, her husband,
Peter Reyn-Bardt, had boasted that he had killed his wife and buried
her in the back garden of their bungalow, which was on the edge of the
area of mossland where peat was being dug. The garden was examined but
no body was recovered there. When Reyn-Bardt was confronted with the
discovery of the skull from Lindow Moss, he confessed to the murder of
his wife.[8] It was later radiocarbon dated, revealing it to be nearly
2,000 years old. Lindow Woman, as it became known, dated from around
210 AD.[9] This emerged shortly before Reyn-Bardt went to trial, but
he was convicted on the evidence of his confession.[8]

Discovery[edit]


The area of Lindow Moss where Lindow Man was discovered A year later a
further discovery was made at Lindow Moss, just 820 feet (250 m)
south-west of the Lindow Woman. On 1 August 1984, Andy Mould, who had
been involved in the discovery of Lindow Woman, took what he thought
was a piece of wood off the elevator of the peat-shredding
machine.[10] He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it
hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it to be a human
foot. The police were called and the foot was taken away for
examination.[4] Rick Turner, the Cheshire County Archaeologist, was
notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of the
body,[11] which later became known as Lindow Man.[12] Some skin had
been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further
deterioration of the body, it was re-covered with peat. The complete
excavation of the block containing the remains was performed on 6
August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the Macclesfield
District General Hospital for storage.[11] As the body of Malika
Reyn-Bardt had still not been found, it was thought possible the body
might be hers, until it was determined to be male, and radiocarbon
dated.[8] The owners of the land on which Lindow Man was found donated
the body to the British Museum, and on 21 August it was transported to
London.[13]

At the time, the body was dubbed Pete Marsh (a pun on peat marsh)
by Middlesex Hospital radiologists, a name subsequently adopted by
local journalists, as was the similar Pete Bogg (a pun on peat
bog).[14][15] The find was announced to the press during the second
week of investigation.[16] As the best preserved bog body found in
Britain, its discovery caused a domestic media sensation and received
global coverage. Sparking excitement in the country's archaeological
community, who had long expected such a find, it was hailed as one of
the most important archaeological discoveries of the 1980s.[1][17] A
Q.E.D. documentary about Lindow Man broadcast by the BBC in 1985
attracted 10 million viewers.[16]

Lindow Man's official name is Lindow II, as there are other finds from
the area: Lindow I (Lindow Woman)[18] refers to a human skull, Lindow
III to a fragmented headless body, and Lindow IV to the upper thigh
of an adult male, possibly that of Lindow Man.[19] After the discovery
of Lindow Man, there were no further archaeological excavations at
Lindow Moss until 1987. A large piece of skin was found by workmen on
the elevator on 6 February 1987. On this occasion, the police left the
investigation to the archaeologists. Over 70 pieces were found,
constituting Lindow III. Although the bone was not as well preserved
as that of Lindow Man, the other tissues survived in better
condition.[20] The final discovery was that of Lindow IV on 14 June
1988. Part of a left leg and buttocks were found on the elevator, from
a site just 50 feet (15 m) west of where Lindow Man was found. Nearly
three months later, on 12 September, a right thigh was discovered in
the peat on the bucket of a digger. The proximity of the discovery
sites, coupled with the fact that the remains were shown to come from
an adult male, means that Lindow IV is probably part of Lindow
Man.[21]

Remains and investigation[edit]


Lindow Man's right foot


Lindow Man's face The discovery of Lindow Man marked the first
well-preserved bog body discovered in Britain; its condition was
comparable to that of Grauballe Man and Tollund Man from
Denmark. Before Lindow Man, it was estimated that 41 bog bodies had
been found in England and Wales and 15 in Scotland. Encouraged by the
discovery of Lindow Man, a gazetteer was compiled and revealed a far
higher number of bog bodies: over 85 in England and Wales and over 36
in Scotland. Prior to the discovery of the bodies in Lindow Moss,
British bog bodies had been a relatively neglected subject compared to
European examples. The interest caused by Lindow Man led to more
in-depth research of accounts of discoveries in bogs since the 17th
century; by 1995, the numbers had changed to 106 in England and Wales
and 34 in Scotland. The remains covered a large time frame.[22]

In life, Lindow Man would have measured between 5'6 and 5'8 (1.68
and 1.73 m) tall and weighed about 132 pounds (60 kg). It was possible
to ascertain that his age at death was around the mid-20s. The body
retains a trimmed beard, moustache, and sideburns of brown hair, as
well as healthy teeth with no visible cavities, and manicured
fingernails, indicating he did little heavy or rough work.[nb 1] Apart
from a fox-fur armband, Lindow Man was discovered completely
naked.[24] When he died, Lindow Man was suffering from slight
osteoarthritis and an infestation of whipworm and maw worm.[25] As a
result of decalcification of the bones and pressure from the peat
Lindow Man was buried under, his skull was distorted.[26] While some
preserved human remains may contain DNA, peat bogs such as Lindow Moss
are generally poor for such a purpose, and it is unlikely that DNA
could be recovered from Lindow Man.[27]

Lindow Man and Lindow III were found to have elevated levels of copper
on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have
been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al proposed that the
bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment.[28] To test
this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and
tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was
found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than
the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al may have
been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall
content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the
body may have been due to environmental factors.[29] Similarly, green
deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a
copper-based pigment used for decoration, however it was later found
to be the result of a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the
acid of the peat bog.[24]



The reconstructed face of Lindow Man. For the process, a replica of
his skull was created from radiographs.[30][31] Dating Lindow Man is
problematic as samples from the body and surrounding peat have
produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing
Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300 BC, Lindow Man
himself has a different date.[32] Early tests at different
laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests
suggested a date between 2 BC and 119 AD.[33][34] There has been a
tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman
due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death may have been a
ritual sacrifice or execution.[34] Explanations for why the peat in
which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist
P. C. Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears
undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was
already some 300 years old.[35] Geographer K. E. Barber has argued
against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have
been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back
to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy
apparently undisturbed.[36]

Lindow Man's last meal was preserved in his stomach and intestines and
was analysed in some detail.[37] It was hoped that investigations into
the contents of the stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet,
as was the case with Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The
analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had
become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such
remains.[38] Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be
mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although
the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an
accident.[39] Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach,
indicating that Lindow Man died in around March or April.[40]

One of the conclusions of the study was that the people buried in
Lindow Moss may have had a less varied diet than their European
counterparts.[41] According to Jody Joy, curator of the Iron Age
collection at the British Museum,[42] the importance of Lindow Man
lies more in how he lived rather than how he died, as the
circumstances surrounding his demise may never be fully
established.[43]

Death[edit]


The top of the Lindow Man's head. The V-shaped cut can be seen at the
lower centre.  As the peat was cleaned off the body in the laboratory,
it became clear that Lindow Man had suffered a violent death. The
injuries included a V-shaped, 3.5-centimetre (1.4 in) cut on top of
his head; a possible laceration at the back of the head; ligature
marks on the neck where a sinew cord was found; a possible wound on
the right side of the neck; a possible stab wound in the upper right
chest; a broken neck; and a fractured rib. Xeroradiography revealed
the blow on top of the head (causing the V-shaped cut) was caused by a
relatively blunt object; it had fractured the skull and driven
fragments into the brain. Swelling along the edges of the wound
indicated Lindow Man had lived after being struck. The blow, possibly
from a small axe, would have caused unconsciousness but Lindow Man
could have survived for several hours afterwards. The ligature marks
on the neck were caused by the tightening of the sinew cord found
around his neck, possibly a garrotte or necklace.[44]

In the case of some injuries, such as the laceration on the back of
the skull, it is not possible to confirm whether they took place
before or after death due to the body's state of decay. This is also
the case for the wound in the upper right chest.[45] The cut on the
right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming
bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the
wound suggest it may have been caused by a sharp instrument such as a
knife.[46] The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after
death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a
garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a
lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have
been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the
body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred
after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included
in some narratives of Lindow Man's death.[47] The broken neck would
have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord around
Lindow Man's neck tightening, or by blows to the back of the head.[48]
After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.[49]

Interpretation[edit] Archaeologist Don Brothwell considers that many
of the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as
those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies,
including these found in Lindow Moss, have contributed to a wider
understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new
methods in analysis and investigation.[50] The use of sophisticated
techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) scans, has marked the
investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such
scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal
examination.[41] Of the 27 bodies recovered from lowland raised mires
in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of
Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The
remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4th
centuries. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary
descriptions of the discovery.[51]

The physical evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow
Man was killed, although some details are debated, but it does not
explain why he was killed.[52] In North West England, there is little
evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What
evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered
from peat bogs.[53] Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the
form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal
ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st century AD, the type of
burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period.[54]
In the latter half of the 20th century, scholars widely believed that
bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were
examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic
and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.[55]

According to Brothwell, Lindow Man is one of the most complex examples
of overkill in a bog body, and possibly has ritual meaning as it was
extravagant for a straightforward murder.[56] Archaeologists John
Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been
related to religious practice, although there is division in the
academic community over this issue.[53] In the case of Lindow Man,
scholars debate whether the killing was murder or done as part of
ritual.[54] Anne Ross, an expert on Iron Age religion, proposed that
the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the triple
death (throat cut, strangled, and hit on the head) was an offering to
several different gods.[57] The wide date range for Lindow Man's death
(2 BC to 119 AD) means he may have met his demise after the Romans
conquered northern England in the 60s AD. As the Romans outlawed human
sacrifice, such timing would open up other possibilities.[33] This
conclusion was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton, who challenged
the interpretation of sacrificial death.[58] Connolly suggests that as
Lindow Man was found naked, he could have been the victim of a violent
robbery.[15][48]

Joy said, The jury really is still out on these bodies, whether they
were aristocrats, priests, criminals, outsiders, whether they went
willingly to their deaths or whether they were executed – but Lindow
was a very remote place in those days, an unlikely place for an ambush
or a murder.[43]

Conservation[edit]


Lindow Man on display at the British Museum in 1996.  It was feared
that once Lindow Man was removed from the peat, which had preserved
the body for nearly 2,000 years, the remains would start to decay, so
steps were taken for preservation. After rejecting methods used to
preserve other bog bodies, such as the pit-tanning used on Grauballe
Man, which took a year and a half, scientists settled on
freeze-drying. In preparation, the body was covered in a solution of
15% polyethylene glycol 400 and 85% water to prevent it from becoming
distorted. The body was frozen solid and the ice vaporised to ensure
Lindow Man did not shrink. Afterwards, Lindow Man was put in a
specially constructed display case to control the environment,
maintaining the temperature at 20 °C (68 °F) and the humidity at
55%.[59][60][61]

Lindow Man is held in the British Museum. Before the remains were
transferred there, people from North West England launched an
unsuccessful campaign to keep the body in Manchester.[62] The bog body
has been on temporary display in other venues: at the Manchester
Museum on three occasions, April to December 1987, March to September
1991,[1] and April 2008 to April 2009; and at the Great North Museum
in Newcastle from August to November 2009.[63] The 2008–09 Manchester
display, titled Lindow Man: A Bog Body Mystery Exhibition at the
Manchester Museum, won the category Best Archaeological Innovation
in the 2010 British Archaeological Awards, run by the Council for
British Archaeology.[64]

Critics have complained that, by museum display of the remains, the
body of Lindow Man has been objectified rather than treated with the
respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned
whether the body should be displayed at all. This is part of a wider
discussion about the scientific treatment of human remains and museum
researchers and archaeologists using them as information sources.[65]

The Icelandic Phallological Museum (Icelandic: Hið Íslenzka Reðasafn),
located in Reykjavík, Iceland, houses the world's largest display of
penises and penile parts. The collection of 280 specimens from 93
species of animals includes 55 penises taken from whales, 36 from
seals and 118 from land mammals, allegedly including Huldufólk
(Icelandic elves) and trolls. In July 2011, the museum obtained its
first human penis, one of four promised by would-be donors. Its
detachment from the donor's body did not go according to plan and it
was reduced to a greyish-brown shrivelled mass pickled in a jar of
formalin. The museum continues to search for a younger and a bigger
and better one.[2]

Founded in 1997 by retired teacher Sigurður Hjartarson and now run by
his son Hjörtur Gísli Sigurðsson, the museum grew out of an interest
in penises that began during Sigurður's childhood when he was given a
cattle whip made from a bull's penis. He obtained the organs of
Icelandic animals from sources around the country, with acquisitions
ranging from the 170 cm (67 in) front tip of a blue whale's penis to
the 2 mm (0.08 in) penis bone of a hamster, which can only be seen
with a magnifying glass. The museum claims that its collection
includes the penises of elves and trolls, though, as Icelandic
folklore portrays such creatures as being invisible, they cannot be
seen. The collection also features phallic art and crafts such as
lampshades made from the scrotums of bulls.

The museum has become a popular tourist attraction with thousands of
visitors a year—60% of them women[3]—and has received international
media attention, including a Canadian documentary film called The
Final Member, which covers the museum's quest to obtain a human
penis. According to its mission statement, the museum aims to enable
individuals to undertake serious study into the field of phallology
in an organized, scientific fashion.[4]

History[edit]


Sigurður Hjartarson, founder of the Icelandic Phallological Museum The
museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal
for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlíd
College before his retirement.[5] As a child, he owned a bull's penis
(or pizzle) which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began
collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis
in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to
friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale
penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through
donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.[6]

The organs of farm animals came from abattoirs, while fishermen
supplied those of seals and the smaller whales. The penises of larger
whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source
dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a
global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to
continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16
whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each
year.[6] He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen
who found the animal drifting on pack ice off the Westfjords.[2] He
was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional
embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent
to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the
workers were taking a lunch break: Someone asked, 'What's in the
basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After
that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'[7] According to
Sigurður, Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can
never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a
better one.[8]



A bull's penis similar to this one, intended for use as a cattle whip,
was given to the museum's founder when he was a boy and sparked a
lasting interest in penises.  The collection was at first housed in
Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching
job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public
display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of
ISK 200,000 to support the opening of a museum in August 1997.[9] By
2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were
from abroad. He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered
it to the city of Reykjavík as a gift.[10] However, he was
unsuccessful in obtaining financial support from the state or
city. When he retired in 2004, he could no longer afford the rent on
the museum's premises.[11]



The former exhibition room in Húsavík, 2008 After his retirement, he
moved along with his collection to Húsavík, a fishing village with a
population of about 2,200 people located 298 miles (480 km) northeast
of the capital. The museum was housed in a small building, formerly a
restaurant,[11] that was marked with a giant wooden penis and a stone
phallus standing outside on the street. The village's inhabitants were
at first skeptical of the new arrival, but came to accept it when they
were persuaded that there was nothing pornographic about the
museum.[2]

In 2012 he handed over the collection to his son, Hjörtur Gísli
Sigurðsson (described by Slate as the world's only hereditary
penis-museum operator[7]). It was relocated from Húsavík to
Reykjavík's main shopping street at Laugavegur 116.[12] Its former
location in Húsavík is now home to The Exploration Museum. [13] An
offer from a wealthy German to buy the museum for ISK 30 million (US
$232,000 / €186,000) and a proposal to move it to the United Kingdom
were both turned down, as Hjörtur insists that the museum has to be
in Iceland.[14] He intends to continue acquiring new penises because
you can always get a better, newer one ... a bigger size or better
shape, you know?[15]

According to University of Iceland anthropologist Sigurjón Baldur
Hafsteinsson, Icelanders' tolerance of the museum is an indicator of
how Icelandic society has changed since the 1990s, when a newly
elected neoliberal government fostered a more open outlook on
entertainment, creativity and tourism that has enabled new ideas to
emerge publicly.[8] He has documented the significance of the
museum's role in Icelandic culture in a forthcoming book, Icelandick:
The Phallological Museum and Neo-liberal Politics.[16]

Collection[edit]


Penis collection with testicle lightshades at the new exhibition room
of the Icelandic Phallological Museum in Reykjavík According to the
museum's website, the collection comprises 280 specimens from 93
species of animals. They range from some of the largest to some of the
smallest penises in the animal world. Its largest exhibit is a portion
of a blue whale's penis measuring 170 cm (67 in) long and weighing 70
kilograms (150 lb),[3] which Iceland Review has dubbed a real Moby
Dick.[17] The specimen is just the tip, as the entire organ, when
intact, would have been about 5 m (16 ft) long and weighed about
350–450 kilograms (770–990 lb). The penis bone of a hamster, only 2 mm
(0.08 in) long, is the smallest item in the collection and needs a
magnifying glass to be viewed.[3] Sigurður has described the
collection as the product of 37 years of collecting penises. Somebody
had to do it.[8]

The museum also has a folklore section exhibiting mythological
penises; its online catalogue lists specimens taken from elves,
trolls, kelpies, and The Nasty Ghost of Snæfell.[18] Sigurður says
that the elf's penis, which the museum's catalogue describes as
unusually big and old, is among his favourites. It cannot be seen,
as Icelandic folklore holds that elves and trolls are invisible.[11]
The folkloric penises also include those of a merman, a one-legged,
one-armed and one-eyed monster called a Beach-Murmurer, an Enriching
Beach Mouse (said to draw money from the sea to enrich her owner),
and an Icelandic Christmas Lad found dead at the foot of a mountain in
1985 and whose penis was presented to the museum by a former mayor of
Reykjavík.[18]

The museum's website states that it enables individuals to undertake
serious study into the field of phallology in an organized, scientific
fashion, giving due prominence to a field that until now has only
been a borderline field of study in other academic disciplines such
as history, art, psychology, literature and other artistic fields like
music and ballet.[18] The museum aims to collect penis specimens from
every mammal in Iceland. It also exhibits phallic artwork and
penis-related objects or phallobilia such as lampshades made from
the scrotums of bulls.[4] Other exhibits range from an 18th-century
engraving depicting the circumcision of Christ to a 20th-century
plastic penis pacifier.[17] Most of the collection has been donated,
and the only purchase to date has been an elephant's penis measuring
nearly 1 m (3.3 ft) long. The penises are either preserved in
formaldehyde and displayed in jars or are dried and hung or mounted on
the walls of the museum.[3]



Penises of minke whales on display at the museum Sigurður has used a
variety of techniques to preserve the penises, including preservation
in formaldehyde, pickling, drying, stuffing and salting.[19] One
particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a
walking stick.[8] Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by
lamps made by Sigurður from rams' testicles.[19] Sigurður has also
carved wooden phalluses, which can be found adorning various objects
around the museum,[2] and has a bow tie decorated with images of
phalluses that he wears on special occasions.[11]

Josh Schonwald of Salon.com described his impressions of the museum
when he visited in 1998:

They were hanging on the walls, stuffed in jars, displayed with
curatorial love – dried penises, penises embalmed in formaldehyde,
massive penises displayed like hunting trophies. A tanned bull's
penis, a smoked horse's penis. There were runty, shriveled penises of
reindeer, foxes, minks and rats. There were seal and walrus penises
with stiff penis bones – ensuring a perpetually erect state. There was
the Big Penis – a 3-foot-long blue whale penis (which could have been
an oar for a canoe).[6]

The museum is open every day[20] and by July 2011 was attracting up to
11,000 visitors annually.[2] Sixty percent of the museum's visitors
are reported to be women,[3] though according to the authors of the
Rough Guide to Iceland, mentioning the museum causes the staff at the
tourist office to blush with embarrassment.[21] The museum's guest
book includes comments such as, I've never seen so many penises–and I
went to boarding school! (from a New Zealand visitor), They're
bigger in the USA, (from someone from Wisconsin) and Is there a
vagina museum?[7] (On this point, Sigurður has said, I'm only
collecting the male organ. Somebody else has to do the other job. I'd
be interested in how they would preserve it. I think vaginas are
better alive.[22])

Human penis[edit] For many years, the museum sought to obtain a human
penis. Sigurður was able to obtain human testicles and a foreskin from
two separate donors;[23] the foreskin was donated by Iceland's
National Hospital after an emergency circumcision operation.[21] The
museum also contains sculptures of 15 penises based on the Iceland
national handball team. As the team had won the silver medal at the
2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the penises were made from a silvered
material. Sigurður claims that although they are not displayed in the
same order as the individuals shown in the photograph that accompany
them, their wives would recognise them.[2] According to Slate, these
sculptures were created by Sigurður's daughter, Þorgerður
Sigurðardóttir, and were based on her own experience rather than any
knowledge of the team. The team's goalkeeper denies that the
sculptures are casts.[7]

The museum has so far received pledges from four men—an Icelander, a
German, an American and a Briton—to donate their penises. Canadian
film-maker Zach Math comments that the American is an ordinary guy
but he has this quirk where he thinks of his penis as a separate
entity from his body — Elmo. He has this dream that he wants it to be
the most famous penis in the world.[24] According to Sigurður, the
American donor wanted to have his penis cut off even during his
lifetime and then visit the museum.[11] The American sent a cast of
his penis to serve as a substitute in the meantime,[3] along with
photographs of it dressed up as Santa Claus and Abraham Lincoln.[25]
The donor also tattooed his penis with the Stars and Stripes to make
it look more attractive.[24]

The Icelandic donor was a 95-year-old man from nearby Akureyri who was
said to have been a womaniser in his youth and wanted to donate his
penis to the museum to ensure his eternal fame.[3] Sigurður said
that, even at the age of 95, the donor remained active, both
vertically and horizontally.[6] However, the donor was said to be
concerned that his penis is shrinking as he gets older and he is
worried it might not make a proper exhibit.[3] His penis was given
priority over those of the non-Icelandic donors in accordance with the
museum's mission to display the organs of Icelandic mammals. Removing
and preserving it was not an easy proposition, as Sigurður explained:
The donor and the doctors are in agreement, it must be taken while
the body is warm. Then bleed it and pump it up. If it cools you can't
do anything, so [the donor] is eager to have it taken warm and treated
to be preserved with dignity.[19]

In January 2011, the Icelandic donor died and his penis was surgically
removed so that it could be added to the museum's collection. The
penectomy was not entirely successful and left the penis a
greyish-brown, shrivelled mass. According to Sigurður, I should have
stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a
normal position. Instead, it went directly into the
formaldehyde. Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður
expressed confidence that I will get a younger and a bigger and
better one soon.[2] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved
human penis is that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the
male members [sic] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like this when I
get old.'[15] Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the
museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: If she dies
first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't
say. She might say no.[2]

Film[edit] The museum is the subject of The Final Member, a film by
Canadian documentarians Zach Math and Jonah Bekhor. It profiles
Sigurður and his quest to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling
the story of the American and Icelandic donors and examining the
quasi-taboo nature of the museum's collection. Bekhor says: I
wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending on how you react to
it really says a lot about what your relationship is with that element
of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and we're
really curious to see how audiences respond. The film premiered on 1
May 2012 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary
Festival.[26]")
